---TITLE---
How Meditation Changes Your Brain — The Science of Mindfulness | Zenscape

---DESCRIPTION---
What actually happens inside your brain when you meditate?

This video breaks down decades of neuroscience research into plain language. You'll learn how mindfulness meditation shrinks the amygdala (your fear centre), thickens the prefrontal cortex (focus and decision-making), and quiets the default mode network (the source of rumination and worry).

Plus: how meditation affects stress hormones, blood pressure, and pain perception — with real studies and numbers.

What's covered:
00:00 Introduction
00:45 What is mindfulness?
03:00 Brain change 1 — The amygdala shrinks
05:00 Brain change 2 — Prefrontal cortex thickens
06:30 Brain change 3 — Default mode network quiets
08:00 Effects beyond the brain
11:00 How much practice do you need?
13:00 Closing and next steps
