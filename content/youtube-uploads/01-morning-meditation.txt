Use Canva's "Magic Media" or AI video feature with this prompt:

  "Slow cinematic sunrise over misty mountains, golden morning light
   filtering through trees, peaceful nature footage, soft warm tones,
   no text, no people, 4K quality, meditation ambiance"

Set duration to match your audio length (~10 minutes).
If Canva limits AI video length, use a slow-zoom on a single
