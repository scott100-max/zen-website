Good morning. You're giving yourself seven minutes before the day takes over, and that's a powerful choice. These few minutes can set the tone for everything that follows. So let's use them well.

You can do this sitting up in bed, in a chair, wherever you are. Just make sure you're upright enough to stay awake. Let your eyes close.

...

Take a deep breath in. A real morning breath. Stretch your lungs open.

...

And let it go.

...

One more. Fill up.

...

And release.

...

Before we do anything else, let's start with some gratitude. Not forced, not performative — just a genuine noticing of something good. It can be simple. You woke up. You have a bed. Someone in your life cares about you. You have coffee waiting. The sun came up.

Think of one thing you're grateful for this morning.

...

Hold it in your mind. Let yourself actually feel the gratitude. Not just think it — feel it.

...

...

Good. Now let's set an intention for the day. Not a goal, not a task — an intention. It's about how you want to show up, not what you want to get done.

Maybe today your intention is patience. Or presence. Or kindness — toward yourself or others. Maybe it's focus. Maybe it's simply to slow down. Maybe it's to notice one beautiful thing.

Let an intention arise. Don't force it. See what comes.

...

...

Hold that intention gently. Not as a demand on yourself. As a compass heading.

...

Now, let's do three minutes of breath focus. Simple, clean, grounding. Just you and your breathing. This is your foundation for the day. A few minutes of stillness before the motion begins.

Follow your breath. In and out. Nothing fancy.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

If your mind jumps to the day ahead — to your schedule, your to-do list, that email — just notice it. Gently bring yourself back. There will be plenty of time for all of that. Right now, just breathe.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Good. Take one final breath. Make it a deep one.

...

And let it out slowly.

...

Open your eyes.

...

You're ready. You've started the day with gratitude, intention, and a few minutes of presence. That's more than most people give themselves in a week. Carry it with you. And when the day gets loud, remember: you can always come back to the breath.

Have a good day. I'll see you next time on Salus.
