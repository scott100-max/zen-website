Yoga Nidra: Deep Rest
Duration: 45 minutes

Ambient: temple
Style: Warm, grounded male narrator
---



This is a yoga nidra session — sometimes called yogic sleep. For the next forty-five minutes, you're going to lie down, listen to my voice, and do absolutely nothing. That's it. No effort. No concentration. No trying to get it right.

Yoga nidra guides you into the space between waking and sleeping — that threshold state where your body is deeply at rest but a thin thread of awareness remains. It's one of the most restorative practices in existence. Research suggests that a single session of yoga nidra can leave you feeling as rested as several hours of conventional sleep. It reduces cortisol, calms the nervous system, and allows deep layers of tension to release that you might not even know you're carrying.

So let's set you up. Lie down on your back. A bed, a couch, a yoga mat on the floor — whatever you have. If you're on a harder surface, you might want a blanket under you for comfort and a pillow beneath your knees to take pressure off your lower back. If your neck needs support, use a small pillow or a folded towel.

Let your feet fall open, about hip-width apart. Let your arms rest alongside your body, a few inches from your sides, palms facing upward. Let your fingers curl naturally. This is shavasana — the corpse pose — and despite the morbid name, it's the most comfortable position you'll ever be asked to hold.

...

If you tend to get cold when you relax, cover yourself with a blanket now. Your body temperature will drop as you settle deeper, and being cold will pull you out of the practice. It's better to be slightly too warm than too cold.

...

Now, make any final adjustments. Shift your hips. Wiggle your shoulders against the floor. Turn your head gently side to side and then let it settle in the centre. Find the position where your body can truly, completely let go. The position where nothing needs to be held.

...

...

Once you're settled, close your eyes. They'll stay closed for the rest of the session.

...

Take a deep, full breath in through your nose. Fill your lungs all the way to the top.

...

And exhale through your mouth with an audible sigh. Let everything go. All the tension. All the holding. All of it.

...

Again. Deep breath in. Expand your ribs. Expand your belly.

...

And exhale, sighing it out. Feel your body getting heavier against the ground.

...

One more. Breathe in fully.

...

And exhale everything. Let your body melt into the surface beneath you. Surrender your weight completely, as though the floor could absorb you.

...

...

Good. From here on out, let your breathing return to its natural rhythm. You don't need to control it. You don't need to breathe deeply or slowly. Just let the body breathe itself, the way it does when you're asleep. Effortless. Automatic. Easy.

...

...

Now, I want you to become aware of the room around you. Without opening your eyes, sense the space you're in. The walls. The ceiling above. The floor beneath. Notice any sounds — near or distant. You don't need to identify them or follow them. Just acknowledge that you're here, in this room, in this moment.

...

...

Now, become aware of your body lying in this room. Feel the full length of your body, from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet. Feel the contact points — where your body meets the surface beneath you. The back of your head. Your shoulder blades. Your upper back. Your lower back. Your hips. Your calves. Your heels. Feel yourself being held up. Supported.

...

...

And now, make a quiet resolve to stay awake. Not rigidly, not anxiously — just a gentle intention to remain aware. If you drift into sleep, that's okay. You'll still receive the benefits. But if you can maintain that delicate thread of awareness while your body sleeps, that's the sweet spot. That's yoga nidra.

...

...

--- SANKALPA (INTENTION) ---

Before we go deeper, we're going to set a sankalpa — a heartfelt intention or resolve. This is a short, positive statement about something you want to cultivate, embody, or affirm in your life. Not a goal exactly — more like a seed of truth that you're planting in the fertile ground of your subconscious mind.

It should be stated in present tense, as though it's already true. And it should be positive — what you are, not what you aren't. Something like: "I am at peace." "I am whole and complete as I am." "I move through life with courage and clarity." "I am worthy of love and belonging." "My body heals and regenerates naturally."

Whatever arises. It might be something you've carried for a long time, or something that surfaces fresh right now. Trust what comes.

...

Take a moment to find your sankalpa. Don't overthink it. Let it come to you — from the heart, not the head. What does your deepest self most want to affirm?

...

...

...

When you have it, repeat it silently to yourself three times. Slowly. With feeling. With conviction. As though you are speaking directly to the deepest layer of your being.

...

...

...

...

Good. Now let the sankalpa go. Release it. Trust that it's been planted. We'll return to it at the end of the practice, when the soil is even deeper and more receptive.

...

...

--- ROTATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS ---

We're going to begin moving awareness through the body now. This is called the rotation of consciousness — nyasa in the yogic tradition. I'll name each body part, and all you need to do is bring your awareness to it. Feel it. Sense it. You don't need to move it. You don't need to relax it. You don't need to visualise it. Just hear the name, feel the part, and move on when I name the next one.

Try to move your awareness at the pace I set, without lingering or rushing. If you can't feel a particular part, that's fine — just intend your awareness toward it and move on. Over time, the felt sense will develop.

And stay awake if you can. The rhythm of this practice can lull you toward sleep. That's fine if it happens, but see if you can ride the edge.

...

Let's begin on the right side of the body.

Bring your awareness to your right hand. The right hand thumb. The right index finger. The right middle finger. The right ring finger. The right little finger.

...

The palm of the right hand. Feel the centre of the palm. The back of the right hand.

...

The right wrist. The right forearm — the inner forearm, the outer forearm. The right elbow. The right upper arm. The right shoulder.

...

The right armpit. The right side of the chest. The right side of the ribcage, expanding and contracting with the breath. The right side of the waist. The right hip.

...

The right thigh — the top surface, the inner thigh, the outer thigh, the back of the thigh. The right knee — the kneecap, the back of the knee.

...

The right shin. The right calf. The right ankle.

...

The top of the right foot. The sole of the right foot. The right big toe. The second toe. The third toe. The fourth toe. The little toe.

...

...

Now, the left side.

Bring your awareness to your left hand. The left hand thumb. The left index finger. The left middle finger. The left ring finger. The left little finger.

...

The palm of the left hand. Feel the centre of the palm. The back of the left hand.

...

The left wrist. The left forearm — inner and outer. The left elbow. The left upper arm. The left shoulder.

...

The left armpit. The left side of the chest. The left side of the ribcage. The left side of the waist. The left hip.

...

The left thigh — top, inner, outer, back. The left knee — front and back.

...

The left shin. The left calf. The left ankle.

...

The top of the left foot. The sole of the left foot. The left big toe. The second toe. The third toe. The fourth toe. The little toe.

...

...

Now the back of the body. You don't need to roll over — just sense what you can.

The right shoulder blade. The left shoulder blade. The whole upper back, broad and wide.

...

The middle of the back, along the spine. The lower back. A common area of tension — just feel whatever's there without trying to change it.

...

The right buttock. The left buttock. The whole back of the pelvis.

...

Now feel the entire back of the body, from the base of the skull down to the heels. One continuous surface, pressed against the ground. Heavy. Supported. At rest.

...

...

Now the front of the body.

The right collarbone. The left collarbone. The hollow at the base of the throat.

...

The upper chest. The centre of the chest, over the heart. Feel whatever's there — perhaps the beating of your heart, perhaps warmth, perhaps nothing particular.

...

The right side of the ribcage. The left side of the ribcage.

...

The upper abdomen, just below the ribcage. The navel. Feel the belly moving gently with the breath. The lower abdomen, below the navel. The pelvis.

...

Feel the whole front of the body. Open, soft, vulnerable, breathing.

...

...

Now the head and the face. This is where we tend to hold a remarkable amount of unconscious tension, so take particular care here.

The crown of the head. The very top. Feel whatever sensation is there.

...

The forehead. Imagine the forehead becoming wide, smooth, spacious. Like a clear sky. Let every furrow, every wrinkle of concern, dissolve.

...

The right temple. The left temple.

...

The right eyebrow. The left eyebrow. The space between the eyebrows — the brow point. Let this area soften completely.

...

The right eyelid. The left eyelid. The eyes themselves, resting softly in their sockets. No need to look at anything. No need to focus. The eyes are completely at rest.

...

The right cheek. The left cheek.

...

The nose. The bridge of the nose. The tip of the nose. The nostrils — feel the faintest whisper of breath passing through.

...

The upper lip. The lower lip. Both lips together — soft, relaxed, perhaps slightly parted.

...

The teeth. Let the jaw release so there's space between the upper and lower teeth. The tongue — let it rest heavily on the floor of the mouth, or drift away from the palate.

...

The chin. The jawline. The jaw joint, right in front of the ears. Let this joint soften and open.

...

The right ear. The left ear. The inner ears, deep within the skull.

...

The back of the head, resting on the pillow or floor. The base of the skull.

...

The throat. Soft, open, unguarded.

...

...

Now, feel the whole body. The entire body, lying here, from the crown of the head to the tips of the toes. One unified field of sensation and awareness. One body, whole and complete, deeply at rest.

...

...

Feel the body breathing. Not you breathing the body — the body breathing itself. The whole body rising and falling as one organism. Alive. Resting. Breathing.

...

...

...

...

--- BREATH AWARENESS ---

Now, without changing your breath in any way, bring your full attention to the natural movement of breathing. Simply observe. Witness the breath as it comes and goes.

...

Notice the breath at the nostrils. Cool air flowing in on the inhale. Warm air flowing out on the exhale. A gentle, continuous river of air.

...

...

...

Notice the breath in the chest. A subtle rise as the lungs fill. A gentle fall as they empty. Effortless. Rhythmic.

...

...

...

Notice the breath in the belly. A soft expansion outward on the inhale. A gentle drawing inward on the exhale. Like a slow tide.

...

...

...

Feel the breath as a wave that moves through the whole body. Inhale — the wave rises from the belly, through the chest, to the collarbones. Exhale — the wave recedes, from the collarbones, through the chest, back to the belly.

...

...

...

Now, if you'd like, begin to silently count your breaths backward from twenty-seven down to one. Each complete breath — one inhale and one exhale — is one count.

Inhale, exhale — twenty-seven.
Inhale, exhale — twenty-six.
Inhale, exhale — twenty-five.

Continue at your own pace. There's no rush. If you lose count or find you've drifted into thought, don't worry about it. Just start again from twenty-seven. There's no penalty for losing count. The counting is just a thread to keep you tethered to awareness.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Let go of the counting now. Let go of watching the breath. Let the breath do whatever it wants. You are simply lying here. Aware. Resting.

...

...

...

...

--- PAIRS OF OPPOSITES ---

We're going to work with opposite sensations now. This is a traditional part of yoga nidra that helps balance the hemispheres of the brain and deepen your state of relaxation. I'll describe a sensation, and you simply try to feel it or remember it or imagine it in your body. Don't strain. Don't worry if you can't conjure the feeling perfectly. Just invite it. Lean toward it. The intention is enough.

...

First: heaviness.

Feel your body becoming heavy. Profoundly heavy. As though your body is made of stone or lead. Your right arm is heavy. Your left arm is heavy. Both arms are so heavy they're sinking into the floor. Your right leg is heavy. Your left leg is heavy. Both legs are incredibly heavy. Your torso is heavy. Your head is heavy. Your whole body is pressing down with enormous weight, sinking deeper and deeper into the surface beneath you.

...

...

...

Feel that heaviness everywhere. In every limb. In every muscle and bone. So heavy you couldn't move if you tried. So heavy the floor might give way beneath you.

...

...

...

Now: lightness.

Feel your body becoming light. The heaviness is draining away, and in its place is lightness. Weightlessness. Your body is buoyant, like a cork in water. Your arms are light. Your legs are light. Your whole body is so light that it begins to float. You're lifting off the ground. Hovering just above the surface. Drifting upward, gently, effortlessly. Light as a feather. Light as a cloud. Weightless.

...

...

...

Feel that lightness in every part of you. Floating. Drifting. Free of gravity.

...

...

...

Now: heaviness and lightness together. See if you can hold both sensations simultaneously. The body is both heavy and light. Both grounded and floating. Both anchored to the earth and free of it. This is a paradox, and the mind may resist it. That's fine. Just feel whatever you feel.

...

...

...

Now let both go. Rest.

...

...

Now: warmth.

Feel warmth spreading through your body. A deep, penetrating warmth, as though you're lying in golden sunshine on a summer afternoon. The warmth is on your skin. It's seeping into your muscles, into your bones, into your organs. Your hands are warm. Your feet are warm. Your belly is warm. Your chest is warm. Your face is warm. A delicious, comfortable, all-encompassing warmth.

...

...

...

...

Feel that warmth everywhere. Let it soften you. Let it melt any remaining tension.

...

...

...

Now: coolness.

Feel a pleasant coolness moving through your body. Like stepping into a cool stream on a hot day. Like a gentle breeze crossing your skin after a long afternoon in the sun. The coolness is refreshing, revitalising. It moves across your forehead. Down your arms. Through your chest. Down your legs. A clean, fresh coolness that wakes every cell.

...

...

...

Feel that coolness throughout your whole body. Fresh. Crisp. Alive.

...

...

...

Now: warmth and coolness together. Both at once. The body holds both without contradiction. Warm and cool. Comfortable and alert. Two streams moving through you simultaneously.

...

...

...

Now let both go. Let the body be exactly as it is. No more invitations. No more effort. Just rest.

...

...

Now: pain — or discomfort. Think of a time when you experienced physical discomfort. You don't need to relive it intensely — just recall the general feeling. The unpleasantness of it. The way the body contracts around it.

...

...

Now: pleasure. Think of a time when you experienced deep physical pleasure or comfort. A warm bath. A massage. Lying in the sun. Being held by someone you love. Feel the ease of it. The way the body opens and softens.

...

...

Now: pain and pleasure together. The body knows both. Has felt both. Can hold both. Neither defines you. Both are temporary. Both are just sensation.

...

...

...

Let everything go. Return to neutral. Just the body, lying here, breathing.

...

...

...

...

--- VISUALISATION ---

We're going to move into a visualisation now. I'll describe a series of images, and your only job is to see them — or feel them, or sense them — as vividly as you can in your mind's eye. Don't analyse them. Don't try to find meaning. Don't judge how well you're visualising. Just let each image arise, exist for a moment, and dissolve. Like clouds forming and unforming in the sky.

...

...

See a candle flame. A single candle, burning steadily in a dark room. The flame is golden, warm, alive. It flickers gently. There's a blue core at the base and a bright yellow tip that dances slightly. The room around it is still. There's no sound but the faintest crackle. Watch the flame.

...

...

...

...

Let the image dissolve. Darkness.

...

...

Now see a wide, calm lake at dawn. The water is perfectly, impossibly still. Like a sheet of glass. The sky above is pale — pink and gold at the horizon, fading upward into soft blue. There's a mist hovering just above the water's surface. No wind. No sound. Not a single ripple. Just the lake and the sky and the first light of morning. Feel the peace of this place.

...

...

...

...

Let the image dissolve.

...

...

See a mountain. A great mountain, snow-capped, ancient, rising from a green valley into a vast blue sky. It has been here for millions of years. It has witnessed ice ages and civilisations and countless sunrises. Storms have battered it. Winds have sculpted it. And still it stands. Unmoving. Patient. Majestic. Feel the stillness of the mountain. Feel its permanence, its unshakeable presence.

...

...

...

...

Let the image dissolve.

...

...

Now see a field of wildflowers stretching in every direction to the horizon. Colour everywhere — red poppies, yellow buttercups, purple lavender, white daisies. The air is warm and fragrant. A gentle breeze moves through the flowers, making them sway and nod. Bees hum lazily. The sky is blue and wide. You're standing in the middle of all this beauty, and there's nowhere else you need to be.

...

...

...

...

Let the image dissolve.

...

...

See the ocean. A vast, calm ocean stretching to the horizon. The water is deep blue, almost indigo. Gentle swells rise and fall — not waves, just the slow, rhythmic breathing of the sea. The sun is low, casting a golden path across the water. You can hear the deep, steady pulse of the ocean. Feel its enormity. Its depth. Its ancient, patient rhythm.

...

...

...

...

Let the image dissolve.

...

...

Now see a night sky. You're lying on your back — just as you are now — looking up at the sky. There are no city lights. No clouds. Just an infinite canopy of stars. Thousands of them. Millions. The Milky Way arches overhead like a river of light. You can see depth in the sky — some stars closer, some impossibly far away. The vast, silent, unimaginable depth of space. And you are here, lying on this small planet, looking up at all of it.

...

...

...

Feel how small you are. And somehow, at the same time, feel how vast you are — because you contain awareness wide enough to take all of this in.

...

...

...

...

Let the image dissolve.

...

...

Now see yourself. See yourself from above, as though you're floating near the ceiling, looking down at your own body lying here. See the peaceful shape of you. The stillness of your body. The gentle rise and fall of your breath. The expression on your face — relaxed, soft, at ease.

...

...

Look at this person with enormous kindness. This person has been through so much. Has worked hard. Has struggled and hoped and feared and loved. Has carried burdens that no one else could see. And right now, in this moment, this person is completely at peace. Completely safe. Completely at rest.

...

...

...

Let the image dissolve.

...

...

Now let all images go. Return to the simple, formless darkness behind your closed eyes. No pictures. No scenes. Just space. Just awareness. Just rest.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

--- DEEP REST ---

You are now in the deepest part of the practice. There is nothing to do. Nothing to visualise. Nothing to follow. Just rest.

...

If you're awake, simply be aware. If thoughts come, let them pass. If sensations arise, let them be. If emotions surface, let them move through you. You don't need to engage with anything. You are the space in which everything appears and disappears.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Just rest. Just be. This is enough. You are enough.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

--- RETURN TO SANKALPA ---

Now, from this deep, quiet place, bring back your sankalpa. Your heartfelt intention. The same words you chose at the beginning. Find them again.

...

...

Repeat your sankalpa silently to yourself three times. Slowly. With deep conviction and feeling. You're planting it now in the most receptive soil there is — in this state between waking and sleeping, the subconscious mind is wide open, ready to receive.

...

...

...

...

...

Trust that it has been received. Trust that it will grow. Trust that it is already true.

...

...

--- RETURN TO WAKING ---

We're going to begin the journey back now. Very slowly. Very gently. There is absolutely no rush. We have all the time in the world.

...

First, become aware of your breathing again. You don't need to change it. Just notice it. The quiet, faithful rhythm of breath that has been sustaining you all along. In. Out. In. Out. Still here.

...

...

...

Now, become aware of your body. Start from the inside — the feeling of being in a body. Then expand outward. Feel the weight of your body on the floor or the bed. The points of contact. The temperature of the air on your skin. The texture of whatever's beneath you.

...

...

...

Become aware of the room around you. Without opening your eyes, sense the space. The dimensions of it. The sounds within it. The quality of light beyond your eyelids.

...

...

Begin to bring some gentle movement back into your body. Start with the smallest movements. Wiggle your fingers, very slowly. Curl them and stretch them. Feel the sensation of movement returning.

...

...

Wiggle your toes. Flex your feet gently.

...

Roll your wrists in small, lazy circles. Roll your ankles.

...

...

Take a deeper breath. A full, nourishing inhale — the first intentionally deep breath in a long while. Feel your lungs expand. Feel your ribcage widen.

...

And exhale slowly, steadily.

...

...

If it feels good, stretch. Extend your arms overhead and reach through your fingertips. Point your toes and make yourself long. Stretch from end to end, like you're waking from a long, restorative sleep.

...

...

And release. Let your arms come back to your sides.

...

Now, keeping your eyes closed, gently roll onto your right side. Take your time. Curl up in a fetal position — knees drawn toward your chest, hands tucked near your face. Rest here for a moment. This is a traditional transitional posture. Feel the ground beneath you. Feel yourself small and safe and whole, like a child sleeping.

...

...

...

...

When you're ready — and only when you're ready — use your hands to slowly, gently press yourself up to a seated position. Let your head come up last. Take your time with this. The practice isn't over until you're sitting up and your eyes are open.

...

...

...

Sit for a moment. Let your eyes stay closed or half-open. Feel the shift from horizontal to vertical. Feel gravity pulling differently. Feel the blood settling.

...

...

Take one more deep, grateful breath in.

...

And exhale it all out.

...

And gently — gently — open your eyes. Let the light come in softly. Don't rush to focus. Just let the visual world seep back in gradually, like dawn breaking.

...

...

...

Welcome back.

You've been somewhere deep. You've given your body and mind a profound rest. Give yourself a moment before you move on to whatever comes next. Drink some water. Stretch a little more. Move slowly for a few minutes.

The rest you just experienced is real and lasting. Your nervous system has been reset. Tension has been released from layers you might not have known were holding it. And the sankalpa you planted is working quietly, beneath the surface, in its own time and in its own way.

...

Thanks for practising with Salus. Rest well, and I'll see you next time.
