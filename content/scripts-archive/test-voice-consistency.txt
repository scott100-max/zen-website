Welcome to this brief mindfulness exercise. Take a moment to settle into wherever you are right now. Feel your feet on the ground, your body supported by your chair or cushion. Let your shoulders drop away from your ears and allow your jaw to soften.

...

Good. Now bring your attention to your breath. You don't need to change anything about it. Simply notice the natural rhythm of breathing in and breathing out. Feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest. The subtle expansion and release of your belly.

...

As you continue breathing naturally, I want you to imagine a warm, golden light beginning to form just above the crown of your head. With each inhale, this light grows brighter and warmer. With each exhale, it begins to flow down through your body, melting away any tension it encounters.

...

Feel this light moving through your forehead, relaxing the space between your eyebrows. Down through your face, softening your cheeks and jaw. Flowing through your neck and into your shoulders, releasing any tightness held there. Let it continue down through your arms to your fingertips.

Now gently begin to bring your awareness back to the room around you. Notice the sounds, the temperature, the space you're in. Take one more deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly open your eyes. You are present, you are calm, you are ready to continue your day.
