Today's practice is all about the breath. Fifteen minutes of just being with your breathing. It sounds simple — and it is. But simple doesn't mean easy. This is one of those practices where you'll really get to see how your mind works. And that's the whole point.

So settle in wherever you are. Sitting is great for this one — somewhere you can be upright but not rigid. Think of a posture that says "I'm alert, but I'm at ease." Feet flat on the floor if you're in a chair. Hands resting wherever feels natural.

When you're ready, let your eyes close.

...

Take a moment to just arrive. You've been doing things — moving, thinking, managing. And now you're here. Just sitting. Let that transition happen.

...

...

Now, without changing anything, turn your attention to your breath. Just notice it. Is it shallow or deep? Fast or slow? Smooth or a little rough? There's no right answer. Just observe, like you're seeing it for the first time.

...

...

Notice where you feel the breath most clearly. It might be at your nostrils — that cool sensation as air enters, that warmth as it leaves. It might be in your chest, the expansion and release. Or in your belly, that gentle rise and fall. Wherever you feel it most, let your attention rest there. That's going to be your anchor.

...

...

Now we're going to add a simple counting technique. This gives your mind something concrete to hold onto, which can be really helpful, especially when you're starting out.

On your next exhale, silently count "one."

Inhale.

Exhale — "two."

Inhale.

Exhale — "three."

Continue counting each exhale up to ten. When you reach ten, start back at one.

And if you lose count — which you will — just start again at one. No frustration. Losing count is not a problem. Noticing that you lost count is the practice working.

Let's begin.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Just breathing and counting. One exhale at a time.

...

...

...

...

If a thought pulls you away, that's fine. You might find yourself at some number like fourteen and realise you went right past ten. That's okay. Smile at it if you can. Start again at one.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Now let's let go of the counting. You've used it to settle in, and now we'll just be with the breath directly.

Pay attention to the full cycle of each breath. The inhale beginning, building, reaching its peak. That tiny pause at the top. And then the exhale, the letting go, the emptying. And another brief pause at the bottom before the next inhale begins.

Each breath is its own small journey. Stay with it from start to finish.

...

...

...

...

Start to notice the quality of each breath. Not to judge it — just to be curious. This breath might feel a little longer than the last one. This one might feel tighter. This one might feel deeply satisfying. Each one is different.

...

...

...

...

...

...

You might find that as you watch the breath without trying to control it, it naturally starts to slow down. It gets a bit deeper, a bit smoother. That's not something you need to make happen. It's just what happens when you pay attention with this kind of gentle awareness.

...

...

...

...

When your mind wanders — and it will, many times — notice what pulled you away. Was it a thought? A sound? An itch? A feeling? You don't need to analyse it. Just note it. "Ah, thinking." "Ah, planning." "Ah, worrying." And then, like turning your head back to watch a sunset, turn your attention back to the breath.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Every time you come back to the breath, you're strengthening something. You're building the capacity to choose where your attention goes rather than being at the mercy of every passing thought. Research shows this kind of practice actually changes the structure of your brain over time — thickening areas associated with attention and self-awareness. So even when it feels like nothing is happening, something is.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Let yourself settle into these final minutes. No counting. No special technique. Just you and your breath in this room.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Now, gently, begin to expand your awareness. Keep the breath in the background, but let yourself notice the room around you. Sounds. Temperature. The light beyond your eyelids.

...

Take one more deep, intentional breath. Make this one count. Fill your lungs completely.

...

And let it all go.

...

Open your eyes when you're ready.

...

That's fifteen minutes of mindful breathing. It's the kind of practice you can come back to again and again — there's always something new to notice. Even in something as familiar as your own breath.

Thanks for being here. I'll see you next time on Salus.
