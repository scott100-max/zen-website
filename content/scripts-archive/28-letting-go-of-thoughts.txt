Today we're going to work with something that trips up almost everyone who tries meditation: thoughts. Specifically, we're going to practice letting go of them.

Now, I want to be clear about something right away. The goal here is not to stop thinking. You can't stop thinking any more than you can stop your heart from beating. Thoughts are what your brain does. It produces thoughts the way your lungs produce breath. So we're not fighting your mind. We're changing your relationship with it.

Settle into a comfortable position. Sitting is ideal. Let your eyes close.

...

Take a few breaths to land here.

...

In.

...

Out.

...

One more.

...

...

Now, for the first minute or so, just watch what happens in your mind. Don't try to meditate. Don't try to focus. Just sit and observe. What shows up? Thoughts about the day. Plans. Memories. Judgments. Fragments of songs. Random images. Just notice the activity.

...

...

...

...

What you're seeing is your mind doing what it does. This stream of mental activity is constant — it's been running in the background your whole life. Normally, we're so caught up in it that we don't even realise it's happening. We don't watch thoughts — we think them. We get absorbed. We become the thought.

The practice today is to step back and watch instead of getting swept away.

...

Here's a metaphor that might help. Imagine you're lying on your back in a field, looking up at the sky. Thoughts are clouds passing overhead. Some are small and wispy — they drift by quickly. Some are big and dark — they seem to fill the whole sky. But no matter what kind of cloud it is, it passes. It always passes.

Your job is to be the sky, not the clouds. To let thoughts drift through without grabbing onto them.

...

Let's try that now. As thoughts arise, just watch them. See them form. Acknowledge them. And let them drift on.

...

...

...

If you find yourself inside a thought — arguing with someone, rehearsing a conversation, solving a problem — that's fine. The moment you notice that's happened, you've already stepped back. Just return to watching.

...

...

...

...

Here's another way to think about it. Imagine you're sitting on the bank of a river. The water is flowing past, and on the surface are leaves. Each leaf carries a thought. Your practice is to sit on the bank and watch the leaves go by. Not to jump in the river and chase them. Not to try to stop the river from flowing. Just sit. Watch. Let them go.

...

...

...

Some thoughts are stickier than others. You might notice that worries or plans are particularly hard to let go of. That's because your brain flags them as important — it thinks you need to deal with them right now. But you don't. Not right now. Right now, your only job is to sit here and watch.

So when a sticky thought comes, you might silently say to yourself, "Not now." Or "I see you." Or simply, "Thinking." And then return to the bank of the river.

...

...

...

...

...

You might also notice thoughts about the practice itself. "Am I doing this right?" "This is boring." "I can't stop thinking." These are just more thoughts. More leaves on the river. More clouds in the sky. Treat them the same way. Notice. Let go.

...

...

...

...

There's real freedom in this. When you realise that you are not your thoughts — that thoughts are events that happen in your mind, not facts about reality — something shifts. You don't have to believe every thought you think. You don't have to follow every urge. You can just watch. And in that watching, there's a kind of space. A kind of peace.

...

...

...

...

Let's sit with this for a few more minutes. Thoughts will come. Let them. Thoughts will go. Let them. You're just here. Watching. Breathing. Present.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Now, gently, let go of the practice. You don't need to watch your thoughts anymore. Just breathe for a moment.

...

...

Take a deep breath in.

...

And out.

...

Let your eyes open softly.

...

Here's what I'd like you to take with you today: you are the awareness behind your thoughts, not the thoughts themselves. And any time you feel overwhelmed by thinking — by worry, by rumination, by mental noise — you can step back. Even for a moment. And watch the clouds go by.

Thanks for practising with me. I'll see you next time on Salus.
