Tonight, I'm going to take you somewhere beautiful.

...

Somewhere quiet and open and still.

...

All you need to do is close your eyes, settle in, and come with me.

...

First, let's get comfortable. Adjust your pillow. Pull the blankets up. Find the position that makes your body say "yes, this is it." Take your time. Move around if you need to. There's no rush tonight.

...

Close your eyes.

...

Take a slow, full breath in through your nose. Feel the cool air entering, warming as it fills your lungs. Feel your chest expand. Feel your belly rise.

...

And exhale through your mouth. Let the air leave you like a long, easy sigh. Feel your body deflate. Feel it settle deeper into the bed.

...

Again. Breathe in, deep and slow. Let the breath fill every corner of your lungs.

...

And out. Letting everything release. Everything soften. Everything go still.

...

One more time. In. Even slower this time. Even deeper.

...

And out. Like you're breathing out the entire day. Every moment, every thought, every bit of effort — out.

...

Good. Let your breathing settle now. Easy and natural. Your body knows the rhythm. It doesn't need your help. Just let it breathe you, the way it always has.

...
...

Now I want you to imagine something with me.

...

It's nighttime. A warm night in late summer. The kind of night where the air itself feels like a blanket — not heavy, not humid, just soft. The kind of night you used to have as a kid, when summer seemed to last forever and the evenings felt endless.

...

The air is still. Barely a breath of wind. And it carries the faint scent of grass and wildflowers — that green, sweet, earthy smell that only comes on warm nights when the ground has been soaked in sun all day and is slowly releasing its heat back into the air.

...

You're walking through a meadow. Not a manicured lawn or a park — a real meadow. Wild and open and rolling, with no fences, no paths, no signs. Just grass and wildflowers stretching in every direction as far as you can see.

...

The grass is tall — up to your waist in places — and it brushes against your hands as you walk. Soft. Cool. Slightly damp with evening dew. Each blade bends gently as you pass through it, then springs back behind you, erasing your path.

...

You're barefoot. The ground is warm beneath your feet — the soil still holds the day's heat. Each step is cushioned by the thick grass. You can feel individual blades between your toes, cool and delicate.

...

Above you, the sky is immense. Wider and deeper than you've ever seen it. There's no city glow here. No streetlights. No buildings. No cars. No screens. Just the sky and the stars and the moon.

...

The moon is full tonight. It hangs low and heavy above the horizon, so large it looks like you could reach out and touch it. It's not the cold, distant moon of winter — it's the warm, golden moon of late summer. Huge and close and generous.

...

It casts a silver-white light across the meadow. Everything glows faintly — the tops of the grass, the edges of the trees in the distance, the path ahead of you, your own hands as they trail through the grass.

...

You can see clearly, even though it's night. The moonlight is that bright. That generous. It's like the world has been lit from within.

...
...

As you walk, you feel your body relaxing. Each step through the meadow takes something from you — not something you need, but something you don't. A worry. A tension. A thought that was stuck on repeat. With every step, it falls away, lost in the grass behind you.

...

Step by step, you're getting lighter. The heaviness of the day is dissolving. The tightness in your shoulders is loosening. Your jaw is unclenching. Your forehead is smoothing. With each step, you're more yourself and less the person the day demanded you to be.

...

The grass whispers around your legs as you move through it. A soft, continuous shushing sound, like a thousand tiny voices saying "shhh, shhh, it's okay, you can rest now." There's a rhythm to it, like the meadow is breathing along with you.

...
...

And then you find it. A perfect spot.

...

A slight rise in the meadow, like a gentle hill, where the grass is shorter and softer. Almost like a natural bed made by the earth itself. The ground beneath it is dry and warm — it held the sun's heat all day, and now it's offering that warmth to you like a gift.

...

You stand here for a moment, feeling the warm ground through the soles of your feet. Looking out at the meadow around you. The silver grass swaying gently. The dark line of trees on the distant horizon. The enormous sky above.

...

And then you lie down.

...
...

Feel yourself settling onto the ground. Your back against the warm earth. The soft grass cushioning you on all sides, folding gently around your body like a nest. It's more comfortable than you'd expect. The ground contours to your body, supporting every curve, filling every hollow.

...

Your head rests back on a pillow of thick, soft grass. Your arms lie at your sides, hands open, palms up. The grass is cool against the backs of your hands. Your legs stretch out in front of you, feet falling slightly apart, ankles relaxed.

...

And your eyes are open to the sky.

...

And what a sky it is.

...
...

The moon has risen higher now. It's moved from the horizon to about halfway up the sky, and its light has shifted from gold to pure, clean silver. The light is everywhere — in the air around you, on your skin, on the grass tips that frame your view of the heavens. It's not harsh or glaring. It's soft. Like a nightlight for the whole world. Like the world's most gentle lamp, turned down to its lowest, warmest setting.

...

Let the moonlight wash over your face. Feel it on your forehead — cool and gentle. Like the lightest touch. Like someone placed a cool silk cloth across your brow.

...

As it touches your forehead, the muscles there smooth out. Your brow unfurrows. The lines that formed during the day — from concentrating, from squinting, from worrying — they dissolve. Your forehead becomes wide and still and calm. Perfectly smooth. Perfectly at peace.

...

The moonlight moves across your eyes. Your closed eyelids feel cool and soothed. Like cool water on a hot day. The muscles around your eyes release. All the strain of looking and reading and staring at screens — it melts away under this gentle silver light. Your eyes feel bathed. Refreshed. Restored.

...

Your cheeks relax under the moonlight. The muscles you use to smile, to talk, to hold expressions all day — they all go soft. Your face is expressionless now. Not blank — peaceful. The face of someone who has nothing to prove and nowhere to be.

...

Your jaw loosens. The moonlight touches the hinge of your jaw on both sides, and those joints unlock. Your teeth part. Your lips rest together softly, or slightly apart. Your tongue settles heavy in your mouth. The moonlight is on your face like a cool cloth, drawing out every last bit of tension, every last trace of the day.

...
...

Now bring your attention to what you can hear.

...

The meadow is not silent. It's alive with the softest sounds. The sounds of a summer night when the world has gone to bed but nature is still awake.

...

Crickets. That steady, rhythmic chirping that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. Hundreds of them, maybe thousands, each one adding its voice to the chorus. It's not loud. It's not intrusive. It's just there — a pulse, a heartbeat, a rhythm that fills the warm air.

...

It's been the soundtrack of summer nights since you were a child. Let it take you back to that feeling. That late-summer, childhood feeling of long days and warm nights and nothing to worry about. Catching fireflies in a jar. Lying on the grass in the backyard. Listening to the grown-ups talk on the porch while the night settled in around you.

...

Let that feeling wrap around you now. That safety. That simplicity. That complete absence of responsibility.

...

An owl somewhere in the distant trees. A low, gentle call. Hoo-hoo. Then silence. Then again, further away. Hoo-hoo. Like the night is having a quiet conversation with itself. The owl isn't in any hurry. It calls when it calls, and the silence between its calls is as peaceful as the call itself.

...

The faintest rustle of wind through the grass. Not a cold wind. Not a strong wind. Just a breath of air moving through the meadow, making the grass tips sway and whisper. It touches your skin — your face, your hands — and it's warm. Body temperature. Like the night itself is breathing on you, gently, slowly.

...

These sounds don't demand your attention. They simply exist alongside you. They've been here every night, whether you were here to hear them or not. Tonight, you're here. And they welcome you. Let them wash over you the way the moonlight does. Let them become part of the landscape of your rest.

...
...

The warmth from the earth below you is spreading up through your body. The ground is like a heating pad set to the gentlest setting — not hot, not even very warm, just that steady, radiant warmth that seeps into your muscles and makes them go slack.

...

Feel it in your lower back — that deep, soothing warmth soaking into muscles that have worked hard today. Muscles that have held you upright, that have bent and twisted and carried your weight. The warmth reaches them, and they release. They let go. They soften into the warm earth.

...

Your lower back releases. Softens. The arch flattens. The tension drains downward, into the ground, carried away by gravity.

...

The warmth moves up your spine. Each vertebra relaxing as the heat reaches it, like a row of candles being lit one by one. Your middle back. Your upper back. The muscles between your shoulder blades — those knots, those tight bands of tension — they dissolve in the warmth. Like ice cubes in warm water.

...

All of them letting go. Releasing into the warm ground beneath you. Your spine feels longer. More spacious. Like there's more room between each vertebra than there was before.

...

Your shoulders are dropping. Sinking toward the earth. The gap between your ears and your shoulders is growing wider. You're not holding your shoulders up anymore — the earth is holding them down. And that's where they should be. Low. Wide. Open. At rest.

...
...

Above you, the stars are extraordinary.

...

Not dozens. Not hundreds. Thousands. Millions, maybe. More stars than you've ever seen, stretching across the sky in great sweeping rivers of light. With no city glow to wash them out, the sky is a tapestry of light and dark, depth beyond depth, world beyond world.

...

The Milky Way is right there — a wide, hazy band of light cutting across the sky directly above you. It's like someone spilled milk across a dark table. Or like a river made of light, flowing from one horizon to the other, and you are lying at the bottom of it, looking up through its luminous current. Billions of stars, so far away they blur together into a soft glow.

...

And scattered across the rest of the sky, individual stars pulse and flicker. Some bright and steady — the close ones, the bold ones. Some faint and distant, barely there, like the ghosts of stars. Some with a bluish tint, hot and young. Some warm and golden, old and steady.

...

You're not trying to identify any of them. You're not looking for constellations or planets. You're not trying to remember which one is which. You're just lying here, looking up, and letting the vastness of it all wash over you.

...

And the vastness does wash over you. It soaks into your mind the way the warmth soaked into your back. There is so much sky. So much space. So much universe. And you are a small, warm, breathing part of it, lying in a meadow on a summer night.

...

There's something deeply relaxing about looking at the stars. It puts everything in perspective. All the things that felt so big and so important today — they're still real, but they're small compared to this. Compared to the sky above you and the earth below you and the ancient light of stars that have been burning since before you were born. Since before anyone was born.

...

It's not that your problems don't matter. They do. But they don't matter right now. Right now, there is only the sky and the stars and the warm ground and your breathing. That's the whole universe, right here.

...

So let them go. Whatever they were. Let the stars hold them for the night. They're strong enough. They've been holding light for billions of years. They can hold your worries for a few hours.

...
...

A shooting star streaks across the sky. A quick, bright line of light, there and gone in two heartbeats. It traced a path from somewhere near the Milky Way to somewhere beyond the horizon, leaving a faint afterimage that fades even as you notice it.

...

You smile. Not because you made a wish. Just because it was beautiful. Just because you happened to be looking at the right part of the sky at the right moment, and you got to see it.

...

Some things are like that. Some of the best things are like that. Brief and beautiful and completely unplanned.

...

Your arms are heavy at your sides, resting in the cool grass. The moonlight has found them too. Feel it moving down your right arm — from your shoulder to your elbow, down your forearm, into your hand. Each place it touches goes soft and warm and heavy. The silver light is like a gentle hand, pressing each part of your arm deeper into the grass.

...

Your right hand lies open in the grass. Your fingers are loosely curled. You can feel individual blades of grass between your fingers. Cool and delicate. The most gentle sensation in the world.

...

And your left arm. The same gentle light. Shoulder to elbow. Forearm to wrist. Hand and fingers. All releasing. All letting go. All becoming part of the meadow, part of the earth, part of the night.

...

Your hands rest in the cool grass beside you, palms up, as if receiving something. And maybe they are. Maybe they're receiving rest. Maybe they're receiving peace. Maybe they're receiving the moonlight itself, letting it pool in their open palms.

...
...

The crickets continue their song. That steady pulse of sound. It hasn't changed since you lay down. It won't change all night. It's almost like a heartbeat. The meadow's heartbeat. The summer's heartbeat.

...

Let your own heartbeat sync with it. Not by trying, but by allowing. Your heart knows what to do. It's been keeping time your whole life. And the crickets have been keeping time for millions of years. Let the two rhythms find each other. Let them settle into the same slow, steady beat.

...

Your heart rate is dropping now. Getting slower. Getting deeper. Each beat is strong but unhurried. There's no emergency. No reason to pump fast. Just a steady, reliable pulse, keeping you alive, keeping you here, keeping you safe.

...

The owl calls again. Further away this time. Maybe moving deeper into the woods. Its voice is softer now — more suggestion than sound. A low, warm note that hangs in the air for a moment and then is absorbed by the silence. It's a lullaby you didn't know you needed.

...
...

Let's move the moonlight down through the rest of your body.

...

Your hips. Feel them heavy against the ground. The earth supporting your full weight. Your hip joints loosening, widening, releasing. All that tension from sitting and standing and walking — the hip flexors that tighten, the glutes that clench — all of it dissolving under the warm ground and the cool moonlight.

...

Your thighs. The long muscles of your upper legs going soft and heavy. The moonlight is a cool silver river flowing down your legs, carrying tension away, carrying effort away, carrying the memory of every step you took today out through your feet and into the ground.

...

Your knees. Those hardworking joints. Let them rest. Let them be loose and easy. No bending. No bearing weight. Just resting, open, relaxed.

...

Your calves. Your shins. Heavy and warm and completely still. The muscles there are dense and tight from walking, from climbing, from standing. But now they're releasing, fiber by fiber, under the moonlight. Going soft. Going slack.

...

Your ankles. Let them go limp. Let your feet fall apart slightly, the way they naturally do when you're completely relaxed.

...

The tops of your feet. The arches. The soles. All softening under the moonlight. The soles of your feet — which have carried you everywhere today, which have been pressed into shoes and pressed against floors — they can finally spread and breathe and relax.

...

Your toes. Each one relaxing. Ten small releases. Ten tiny surrenders. The big toes, the little toes, and everything in between. All done. All finished. All at rest.

...
...

You are lying in a meadow under the full moon, and every part of your body is at rest. The earth holds you from below — warm and solid and ancient. The moonlight covers you from above like a blanket of silver. The stars watch over you like old friends who have known you forever and will be here forever.

...

The grass surrounds you on all sides, and the crickets sing their endless song, and the owl watches from its tree, and the night is exactly as it should be.

...

This is what peace feels like. Not the absence of everything — but the presence of enough. Enough warmth. Enough quiet. Enough beauty. Enough safety. Enough space to let go completely and know that you'll be caught.

...

Enough.

...
...

Your eyelids are heavy now. Even in this imaginary place, your eyes want to close. They've been open to the stars, but now they want to close. So let them. Softly. Gently. Like curtains being drawn at the end of a long, good day.

...

The stars are still there behind your eyelids. Faint points of light in the darkness. Afterimages. Memories of light. They'll be there all night, even if you're not watching. The moon will keep its vigil. The stars will keep their positions. Nothing changes because you close your eyes.

...

Your thoughts are slowing. Like the wind in the meadow — it was already gentle, and now it's almost still. A single blade of grass sways, and then it too goes still.

...

A thought drifts through your mind. You let it pass like a cloud crossing the moon. It blocks the light for a moment, dims the silver for an instant, then moves on, and the moonlight returns. Bright and full and undiminished.

...

Another thought. Another cloud. Drifting. Passing. Gone.

...

The spaces between thoughts are growing longer. More moonlight. More quiet. More rest. The gaps are wider than the thoughts now. The silence is bigger than the noise. Peace is winning.

...
...
...

The meadow is doing what it does every night. The grass is settling. The dew is forming, tiny droplets on every blade, catching the moonlight and turning each one into a small jewel. The creatures of the night are going about their quiet business — the owls hunting, the mice hiding, the beetles trundling through the undergrowth.

And you are part of it. Part of this landscape. Held by the same gravity, lit by the same moon, breathing the same warm air. You're not a visitor here. You belong. You've always belonged.

...

You belong here.

...

You belong in this rest.

...
...

Your breathing has deepened. Long, slow waves of breath. Your chest rising and falling like the meadow grass in the gentlest breeze. You're not thinking about breathing. You're not thinking about anything. You're just here. Just body. Just warmth. Just breath.

...

The warmth of the earth has soaked all the way through you now. From the surface of your back, through your muscles, through your bones, all the way to the front of your body. You and the ground are nearly the same temperature. The boundary between your body and the earth is blurring. You're not lying on the ground anymore — you're part of it. Gravity has won. The earth has claimed you, gently, lovingly, and you've let it.

...

Heavy. Warm. Still. At peace.

...
...

The moon is moving slowly across the sky. An inch an hour. You can't see it move — it's too slow for that — but you can feel the light shifting slightly. A shadow that was here is now there. The angle has changed. Time is passing, but it doesn't matter. Time is irrelevant in the meadow. There are no clocks here. No schedules. No deadlines. Just the slow turning of the earth and the slow crossing of the moon and your slow, deep, steady breathing.

...

Nowhere to go.

...

Nothing to do.

...

Just this.

...

Just rest.

...
...

The crickets are softer now. Or maybe you're just further away from them. Further from everything. Drifting. Sinking into the warm ground. Sinking into sleep. The sounds of the meadow are receding, like a shore you're drifting away from on a very slow, very warm current.

...

The owl is silent. It flew away while you weren't paying attention. Or maybe it's still there, watching you with its wide, knowing eyes. Either way, it's quiet.

...

The wind is still. Completely still. Not even the tops of the grass are moving. The whole meadow is holding its breath.

...

Even the stars seem to be holding their breath, waiting for you to let go completely. Waiting for that moment when the last thread of wakefulness snaps, gently, and you fall — not down, not up, just away — into sleep.

...

So let go.

...

Let the meadow hold you.

...

Let the moonlight cover you.

...

Let the night take you wherever it wants to take you.

...
...

Down.

...

Deeper.

...

Into the warm dark.

...

All the way down.

...

Into the most peaceful sleep you've had in a long time.

...
...
...

[gentle silence]

...
...
...
...

The meadow will be here when you wake. The stars will be here. The moon will have crossed the sky and set, and the first light of dawn will be touching the tops of the grass. But that's hours from now. Hours and hours. For now, you sleep. Deep and easy and warm. Held by the earth. Lit by the moon. Safe in the meadow.

...

Goodnight from Salus.

...
...
...
