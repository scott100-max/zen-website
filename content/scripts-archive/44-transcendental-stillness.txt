TRANSCENDENTAL STILLNESS
Duration: 25 minutes
Style: Warm, grounded male narrator

---



This is a practice of deep stillness. Over the next twenty-five minutes, we're going to settle down through layers — breath, body, mind — and then let go of all technique entirely. What remains, when you stop doing anything at all, is stillness. Not something you create or achieve, but something that's already here, underneath the noise. Something you uncover simply by ceasing to cover it up.

This session has long stretches of silence. That's not empty space between guidance — it is the practice. Stillness doesn't come from listening to words. It comes from the spaces between them. And eventually, from the absence of them altogether.

If you're comfortable sitting for twenty-five minutes with minimal instruction and extended silence, you're ready.

...

Take your seat. Upright. Stable. Comfortable enough to remain still for the full session. Close your eyes.

...

...

Arrive here. Fully. Completely. Feel the weight of your body. Feel the contact with the floor, the chair, the cushion — whatever is holding you. Feel gravity pulling you down, and feel the ground pushing back, holding you up.

...

...

Take a long, slow breath in through your nose. Fill the lungs completely. Feel the ribcage expand. Feel the belly rise.

...

And a long, slow exhale. Let everything go. All the tension, all the holding, all the accumulated momentum of the day. Let the exhale carry it out. Let your shoulders drop. Let your jaw release.

...

...

Another one. Slow breath in. Drawing in stillness.

...

Slow exhale. Releasing everything that isn't still.

...

...

And one more. Breathe in. Fully. Completely.

...

And exhale. A long, complete exhale. Let the breath go until there's nothing left. Sit in that empty pause for just a moment before the next breath comes on its own.

...

...

...

Good. Now let the breath find its own rhythm. You're not breathing anymore. The body is breathing. You're just here, watching, noticing, settling.

...

...

...

...

Notice the breath becoming quieter as you settle. This happens naturally. As the body relaxes and the mind calms, the breath becomes shallower, softer, more subtle. There's less to metabolise. Less to process. The system is winding down.

Let it happen. Don't try to maintain deep breathing. Don't try to breathe in any particular way. Let the breath become almost imperceptible if it wants to. Like a sleeping baby's breath — barely there.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

There's a point where you almost can't tell if you're breathing or not. Where the breath is so quiet, so subtle, that it seems to dissolve into the stillness of the body. If you reach that point, don't panic. Don't take a big breath to reassure yourself. Just trust the body. It knows what it's doing. It will breathe as much as it needs to.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Now, let go of paying attention to the breath. You don't need to track it anymore. Let the breath continue on its own, unobserved, like a clock ticking in another room.

...

Let your attention settle into the body as a whole. Not scanning for sensations. Not investigating anything. Just a broad, soft awareness of the entire body sitting here. The shape of it. The weight of it. The aliveness within it.

...

...

...

...

Heaviness. Warmth. A subtle vibration — the hum of a living system at rest. Whatever is here, just notice it without engaging. Without commentary. Without interest or disinterest. Just a soft, impartial knowing.

...

...

...

...

...

Feel the stillness of the body. You are not moving. Nothing needs to move. Nothing needs to be adjusted or shifted. The body is at complete rest, and you are aware of that rest. You are aware of the stillness.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Now, let go of the body too. You've used the breath as an anchor, then the body as an anchor. Now release the last anchor. Don't focus on anything.

...

What remains when you're not paying attention to anything in particular?

...

...

...

There's still awareness. There's still knowing. Even without an object to focus on, even without anything to do, something is here. Something is awake. Something knows.

Rest in that. Rest as that.

...

...

...

...

...

I'm going to be mostly quiet now. For the next stretch, your only instruction — and it's barely an instruction at all — is: do nothing.

Don't meditate. Don't try. Don't focus. Don't relax. Don't let go. Don't hold on. Don't do anything with your mind at all.

Just be still.

If you notice that you're trying to be still — that there's an effort, a project, a subtle doing — let that go too. Stillness isn't something you produce. It's what's left when you stop producing.

Stillness is not the absence of movement. It's not the absence of thought. It's not the absence of sound or sensation or feeling.

It's the presence of something that doesn't move. Something that was here before the breath, before the body, before the first thought of this session. Something that has been here your entire life — through every experience, every emotion, every upheaval, every change. A ground beneath all grounds. A silence beneath all sounds.

It has always been here. You've just been too busy to notice.

...

...

...

...

There is nothing to achieve right now. There is nothing to become. There is nowhere to go and no one to be. There is only this. Only here. Only now.

And this is enough. More than enough.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Gently. Very gently. Without rushing. Without breaking anything.

Allow the world to begin re-entering.

...

...

Feel the breath again. Don't force it — just notice that it's there. It never stopped. It's been here the whole time, quietly sustaining you. A faithful rhythm.

...

...

...

Feel the body. Start from the core and move outward. Feel your torso. Your arms. Your legs. Your hands. Your feet. The surface beneath you. The air on your skin.

...

...

...

Hear the sounds around you. Don't reach for them. Let them come to you. Let them arrive in the stillness, the way ripples arrive at the shore.

...

...

...

Take a slightly deeper breath in. The first intentionally deep breath in a long while. Feel the lungs expand. Feel the ribs stretch.

...

And let it out slowly. Feel the release.

...

...

...

There's no hurry to open your eyes. Sit here for a moment in this in-between space. This place where inner stillness and the outer world aren't quite separate yet. Where everything is quiet, and alive, and close.

...

...

...

...

When you're ready — and only when you're ready — gently open your eyes. Let the light come in gradually. Let shapes and colours resolve. Let the room reappear around you.

...

...

Move slowly for the next few minutes. Walk slowly. Speak slowly. Eat slowly. Let the stillness linger in your body and your movements and your voice.

It will — if you let it. And the more you practise this, the more it stays. Not as a special state, but as a quiet undertone to everything you do. A depth beneath the surface. A silence beneath the noise.

That's what this practice builds. Not a skill. Not a technique. A relationship — with the stillness that was always, already here.

...

...

Thanks for practising with Salus. Be still when you can.
