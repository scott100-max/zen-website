Good morning. You've made a great choice starting your day here. The next ten minutes are going to help you wake up your mind, set a clear direction, and step into your day with purpose. Not with urgency or anxiety. With clarity.

So find a comfortable position. Sitting up is better than lying down for this one, since we want your mind alert, not drifting back toward sleep. Feet on the floor. Spine tall but not stiff. Hands resting easily. And gently close your eyes.

...

Let's start by simply arriving. You're here. You're awake. A new day has started and nothing about it has been decided yet. That's a powerful place to be. Right now, the day is a blank page. And you get to choose how you want to write it.

...

...

Take a slow, full breath in through your nose. Feel the cool air entering your lungs. Let it fill your chest and your belly.

...

And breathe out through your mouth. Slow and easy. Let the last traces of sleep leave your body with that exhale.

...

Again. In through the nose. Imagine you're breathing in the morning. Fresh air, new energy, possibility.

...

And out. Releasing heaviness. Releasing any residual tiredness.

...

One more. A big one this time. Fill up completely.

...

And let it all go.

...

...

Good. Now let's add some energy. We're going to do a short round of energising breaths. These are quicker, sharper breaths that wake up your system. Breathe in and out through your nose, about one breath per second. Keep them light, from the belly. We'll do about fifteen of these.

Ready? Let's go.

In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out. In, out.

...

Now take a deep, slow breath in and hold it for a moment.

...

...

And release slowly.

...

...

Notice how you feel. A little more awake. A little more present. That's your respiratory system kicking your brain into gear. More oxygen, more alertness. Simple physiology.

...

Now let's turn to your mind. I want you to think about today. Not the whole to-do list. Not every meeting and obligation. Just the essence of it. If today goes well, what does that look like? What's the one thing that, if you accomplished it, would make today feel worthwhile?

...

...

Let that surface. Don't force it. Just let the most important thing rise to the top.

...

Got it? Good. That's your north star for the day. Everything else is secondary.

...

Now let's visualise. I want you to imagine your day unfolding from this moment forward. See yourself moving through the morning. You're calm, you're clear, you're unhurried. You handle things as they come. You're not reactive. You're intentional.

...

...

Picture yourself sitting down to your most important work. You're focused. Your mind is sharp. The work flows. You're making progress and it feels good. Not because it's easy, but because you're showing up fully.

...

...

If there are conversations or meetings today, see those going well too. You're present with people. You're listening. You're clear when you speak. You're not distracted, not rushing to the next thing.

...

...

See yourself at the end of the day. How do you feel? Satisfied. Not necessarily because everything went perfectly, but because you were there for it. You were engaged. You didn't sleepwalk through it.

...

...

Now let's set an intention. This is different from a goal. An intention is about how you want to be, not what you want to get done. Think about the quality you want to bring to this day. Maybe it's patience. Maybe it's focus. Maybe it's courage. Maybe it's ease.

...

Whatever word or phrase comes to you, let it settle in.

...

...

Say it to yourself silently. "Today, I bring..." and complete that sentence.

...

...

Good. That's your compass. When the day gets noisy, and it might, you can come back to that intention. It'll help you recalibrate in seconds.

...

Let's take three more breaths to seal this in. Each breath is a quiet commitment to the day ahead.

Breathe in. You're awake.

...

Breathe out. You're ready.

...

Breathe in. You know what matters.

...

Breathe out. You're going to show up for it.

...

Breathe in. This day is yours.

...

Breathe out. Let's go.

...

...

Start to gently open your eyes. Let the light in slowly. Look around the room and let yourself fully arrive in the morning.

...

Take a moment before you reach for your phone or your laptop. Just one moment of stillness. You've set your intention. You've seen the day go well. Now go make it happen.

Thanks for practising with Salus. Have a great day.
