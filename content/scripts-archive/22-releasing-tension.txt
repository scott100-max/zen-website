This session is about your body. Not your thoughts, not your to-do list — just the physical vehicle that's been carrying you through everything. It's been working hard. Let's give it some attention.

...

Find a comfortable position. Sitting with your feet flat on the floor is ideal, but lying down works just as well. Whatever you choose, try to let your posture be relaxed but not collapsed. Easy, not effortful.

...

Close your eyes if you'd like. Or just soften your gaze.

...

Take a breath. A full one. In through the nose, filling your chest and then your belly.

...

And out. Let it be slow. Let it be complete.

...

Again. In.

...

And out.

...

...

Now bring your attention to the top of your head. Just notice it. The crown of your skull. There's often tension here that we never think about — a subtle tightness across the scalp. See if you can find it.

...

And if it's there, just intend to soften it. You don't need to do anything physical. Just direct a kind of gentle attention to it, and give it permission to release.

...

...

Move to your forehead. Smooth it out in your mind. Feel the skin relax. The muscles underneath letting go.

...

Your eyes. Even behind closed lids, the muscles around your eyes can be working. Let them stop. Let your eyeballs feel heavy in their sockets. That might sound strange, but just try it.

...

...

Your cheeks. Your jaw. Let your mouth hang open slightly. Let your tongue rest flat and easy. The jaw is one of the biggest tension holders in the body. We clench without knowing it — when we concentrate, when we worry, when we sleep. Let all of that go now.

...

...

Take a breath.

...

...

Now your throat. There's a softness you can find here. Like the muscles around your throat are standing down from guard duty. Let your throat be open. Relaxed.

...

Now bring your awareness to your neck. Start at the base of your skull and slowly move your attention down. Notice any tightness. Any spots that feel hard or rigid.

...

You don't need to stretch or crack or force anything. Just notice the tension, and then imagine that spot softening. Like a knot being gently worked loose by careful hands.

...

...

The sides of your neck. Where the muscles connect to your shoulders. This is a junction where stress loves to accumulate. Give it time. Give it warmth. Give it permission.

...

...

...

Now your shoulders. Let them drop. You might be surprised by how far they fall. Most of us walk around with our shoulders hiked up without realising it.

...

Let them settle. Let them be heavy. Imagine the weight of your arms gently pulling your shoulders downward. Easy. Effortless.

...

...

Now move your awareness across the top of your shoulders and down into your upper arms. The deltoids. The biceps. Let them soften. They don't need to hold anything right now.

...

Through your elbows. Your forearms. All the small muscles that grip and type and carry and hold. Let them rest.

...

...

Into your wrists. Rotate them gently in your mind. Feel them loosen.

...

Your hands. Your palms. Your fingers. Let your hands be open and soft. Imagine all the work they've done today — all the tension they've collected — quietly draining away through your fingertips.

...

...

...

Take a breath. Let it be slow and easy.

...

...

Now your chest. Notice the movement of your breathing here. Feel the ribs expand and contract. There's a tightness some of us carry in the chest — a bracing, like we're waiting for bad news. See if you can find it.

...

And let it go. Let your chest be open. Wide. Free.

...

...

Your upper back. Between the shoulder blades. This area takes the strain of every hunch, every lean forward, every hour at a desk. Imagine the muscles here lengthening. Spreading apart gently. The tension dissolving.

...

...

Down through your mid-back. Your lower back. Another major stress storage site. The lower back holds physical tension and emotional weight. It doesn't distinguish between the two.

...

Let it soften. Feel it release into whatever's supporting you. Let the surface beneath you take the weight. You don't need to hold yourself up right now.

...

...

...

Your stomach. We brace here more than almost anywhere else. Fear, stress, worry — they all live in the gut. Notice if your abdomen is tight.

...

And let it go soft. This might feel vulnerable. That's OK. You're safe here. Let your belly be easy.

...

...

Your hips. The hip flexors. The muscles of your pelvis. If you've been sitting a lot, there's stored tension here. Deep tension. The kind that sits beneath awareness.

...

Bring your attention to it. Breathe into it. Imagine space opening up in and around your hips. A loosening. A widening.

...

...

...

Down into your thighs. The quads, the hamstrings. Big muscles that do big work. Let them go slack. Heavy. Resting.

...

Your knees. Just notice them. Let them be.

...

Your calves. Your shins. Muscles that carry you everywhere, every day. Let them soften.

...

...

Your ankles. Your feet. The soles of your feet. There are thousands of nerve endings here. Bring your awareness to them. Feel the aliveness in your feet. And then let them relax. Completely.

...

Your toes. Let them uncurl. Let them be easy.

...

...

...

Now take a moment to feel your whole body at once. From the top of your head to the soles of your feet. You've moved through every region, softened every spot you could find.

...

Your body is quieter now. Softer. More settled. This is what it feels like when stored stress is released. It's not dramatic. It's just... ease. A return to something that was always available but got buried under the day.

...

...

...

Stay here. Rest in this. There's no rush to come back.

...

...

...

When you're ready, begin to deepen your breath. Let each inhale bring a little more energy back. A little more wakefulness.

...

Move your fingers. Your toes. A gentle stretch — whatever your body asks for.

...

And open your eyes. Slowly. Let the room return.

...

Your body just told you what it needed. Try to listen to it more often. It's usually right.

This has been Salus. Take it easy.
