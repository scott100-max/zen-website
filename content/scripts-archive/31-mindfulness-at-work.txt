This is a quick mindfulness reset designed for your workday. Whether you're at a desk, at home, between meetings, or just feeling that mid-afternoon fog — this practice is for you. Eight minutes. That's it. Let's make them count.

You don't need to go anywhere special. Stay right where you are. If you can, close your office door or put on headphones. But even if you're in an open space, you can do this. Nobody needs to know you're meditating. You'll just look like someone sitting quietly for a few minutes.

Place both feet flat on the floor. Sit back in your chair. Let your hands rest on your thighs or on the desk. You can close your eyes if that feels okay, or just lower your gaze and let your focus go soft.

...

Take one big breath. A real one. Fill your lungs all the way up.

...

And let it all out. Audibly if you can. A sigh. Let the exhale carry some of that accumulated tension with it.

...

One more. Deep in.

...

And out. Good.

...

Now, do a quick inventory. No judgment, just noticing. How does your body feel right now? Are your shoulders up near your ears? Is your jaw clenched? Are you gripping your hands or scrunching your forehead?

...

Just notice. And if you find tension, see if you can soften it. Drop the shoulders. Unclench the jaw. Open the hands. You've probably been holding this tension for hours without realising it.

...

...

Now notice your mind. What's the weather in there right now? Busy? Scattered? Foggy? Anxious? Calm? Again, no judgment. Just see what's present. You're taking a snapshot of your internal state. That awareness alone is valuable.

...

...

Let's do two minutes of breath focus. Just enough to reset your nervous system. Follow the breath in and out. Don't control it. Just watch it.

...

...

...

...

...

If work thoughts come in — and they will — that's fine. You might think of an email you need to send or a problem you're working through. Just notice: "Work thought." And come back to the breath. It'll still be there when you're done.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Good. Now, before we finish, let's set an intention for the rest of your workday. This doesn't need to be grand. Something simple and specific.

It might be: "I'll do one thing at a time." Or: "I'll take a breath before responding to emails." Or: "I'll notice when I'm getting tense and take a moment." Or simply: "I'll pay attention."

Take a moment and let an intention form.

...

...

Hold that intention in your mind. Not as pressure. Not as another item on the to-do list. Just as a quiet guide for the next few hours.

...

Take one more breath. In.

...

Out.

...

Open your eyes. Roll your shoulders if that feels good.

...

You're ready. Eight minutes. You've given your attention a reset, your body a check-in, and your mind a direction. That's a good use of eight minutes.

When you feel that foggy, scattered, overwhelmed feeling creep back in — and it will — remember you can always pause. Thirty seconds of breath awareness at your desk can shift your entire afternoon.

Thanks for taking this time. I'll see you next time on Salus. Now go do good work.
