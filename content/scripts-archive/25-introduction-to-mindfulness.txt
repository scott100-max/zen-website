This is your introduction to mindfulness.

...

And I want to start by saying something simple: if you're here, you've already taken the most important step. You showed up. That matters more than you might think.

...

So let's begin by getting comfortable. You can be sitting in a chair, on a cushion, on the floor — wherever feels right. The goal isn't to look a certain way. It's just to be here.

Let your hands rest wherever they naturally fall. Your lap, your knees, by your sides. And if you're comfortable doing so, gently close your eyes. If that doesn't feel right, just soften your gaze toward the floor a few feet in front of you.

...

Now, before we go any further, let's talk about what mindfulness actually is. Because there's a lot of noise around this word, and I think it helps to keep it simple.

Mindfulness is paying attention to what's happening right now — on purpose, and without judging it. That's it. You're not trying to empty your mind. You're not trying to feel a certain way. You're just noticing what's already here.

And here's the thing that surprises a lot of people: you already do this sometimes. When you really taste your morning coffee. When you catch yourself watching the rain. Those are moments of mindfulness. We're just going to practice doing it intentionally.

...

So let's start with your breath. Not because breathing is magical, but because it's always happening. It's always available as something to pay attention to.

Don't try to change your breathing. Don't try to breathe deeper or slower. Just notice it as it is.

...

Feel the air coming in through your nose or mouth.

...

Feel your chest or belly expand slightly.

...

And feel the exhale. The release.

...

Just that. In and out. The simplest thing in the world.

...

...

Now here's what's going to happen — and I want you to know this in advance so you don't think you're doing it wrong. Your mind is going to wander. It might have already. You might be thinking about what you need to do later, or what happened this morning, or whether you're sitting the right way.

That's completely normal. That's not a failure. That's actually the practice.

The moment you notice your mind has wandered — that moment of noticing — that is mindfulness. You just did it. The whole point is to catch yourself, and then gently, without frustration, bring your attention back to the breath.

Think of it like training a puppy to sit. The puppy wanders off. You don't yell at the puppy. You just gently guide it back. Again and again. That patience, that gentleness — that's the skill you're building.

...

So let's practice that now. For the next couple of minutes, just keep your attention on the breath. And when your mind wanders — and it will — notice where it went, and come back.

No judgment. Just a gentle return.

...

...

...

Now breathe in gently.

...

And slowly breathe out.

...

...

...

If you've been pulled away by a thought, that's okay. You might notice it was a thought about the future. Or a memory. Or a worry. Just name it quietly — "thinking" — and come back to the breath.

...

...

...

...

...

You're doing this exactly right. Even if it feels clumsy. Even if your mind has wandered a dozen times. Every single return to the breath is a repetition. It's like a bicep curl for your attention. And over time, this gets easier. Not because your mind stops wandering — it never fully stops — but because you get faster at noticing, and kinder about coming back.

...

...

Let's take a few more breaths together.

...

Breathe in slowly.

...

And breathe out.

...

Breathe in once more.

...

And let it go.

...

Now, gently begin to widen your awareness. Notice the sounds around you. The feel of the surface beneath you. The temperature of the air.

...

And when you're ready, let your eyes open softly.

...

That's it. That's mindfulness. You just practiced it. And the beautiful thing is, you can bring this same quality of attention to anything — eating, walking, listening to someone speak. It's not limited to sitting with your eyes closed.

If you take one thing from this session, let it be this: you don't need to stop your thoughts to be mindful. You just need to notice them. And then, gently, come back.

Thanks for practicing with me. I'll see you next time on Salus. Take good care.
