## Silence Announcement Phrases

Before a long silence, narrator should say something like:

- "I'm going to leave you in silence now for a little while. Just rest here, breathing gently..."
- "I'll be quiet now and let you drift. There's nothing you need to do..."
- "Take this time in stillness. I'll return in a moment..."
- "Let the [rain/waves/sounds] hold you now. I'll be back soon..."
