# Salus Audio Session Specifications

Guidelines for structuring meditation and sleep audio sessions.

---

## Silence Requirements by Duration

**ALL sessions have existing short pauses (5s, 10s, 15s, etc.) - these remain unchanged.**

The following MUST be added based on duration:

### Short Sessions (Under 10 minutes)
- **Add ONE 30-second pause** (ambient continues so listener knows it hasn't stopped)
- No narrator announcement needed

### Medium Sessions (10-20 minutes)
- **Add ONE 30-second pause**
- **Add ONE 60-second silence** with narrator announcement
- Narrator announces: *"I'm going to be quiet for a little while now..."*

### Long Sessions (20+ minutes)
- **Add ONE 30-second pause**
- **Add ONE 60-second silence** with narrator announcement (around 40-50% mark)
- **Add ONE 90-second silence** with narrator announcement (around 70-80% mark)

**Ambient continues through ALL pauses and silences.**

## Silence Announcement Phrases

Before a long silence (60+ seconds), narrator MUST announce it:

- "I'm going to be quiet now for a little while. Just let the [rain/waves/sounds] hold you..."
- "I'll be silent for a moment. There's nothing you need to do..."
- "Take this time in stillness. I'll return in a moment..."
- "Rest here now. I'll be back soon..."

**IMPORTANT:** Never have extended silence without ambient sound - listener must know audio is still playing.

## Ambient Sound Levels

| Element | Level (dB relative to narration) |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| Ambient during speech | -18 dB |
| Ambient during short pauses (<30s) | -15 dB |
| Ambient during long silence (30s+) | -12 dB (more present) |
