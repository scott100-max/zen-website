What is the weather like outside right now?

...

You probably know the answer to that without even checking. But here is a harder question. What is the weather like inside you right now? What emotional system is moving through you at this moment?

...

...

Today you are going to learn a method for working with emotions that has been used in clinical settings for decades. It comes from the psychologist and meditation teacher Tara Brach, and it is called RAIN. Four letters, four steps, and it works on everything from mild irritation to the emotions that keep you awake at three in the morning.

...

...

R is for Recognize. A is for Allow. I is for Investigate. N is for Nurture. Those are the four steps. By the end of this session, you will know how to use all of them.

...

...

Close your eyes, and let your body get comfortable wherever you are.

...

...

...

Let us start with R. Recognize. This is the act of naming what is happening inside you, right now, with honesty and precision.

...

Take a moment and check. Not what you think you should be experiencing, but what is actually present. Are you tired? Alert? Restless? Bored? Content? Is there an undercurrent of worry, or a vague sense of anticipation? Name whatever you find.

...

...

...

Recognition sounds straightforward, but most people skip it entirely. An emotion arrives and they are already reacting to it before they have even identified what it is. The act of naming, saying to yourself that is anxiety, or that is frustration, creates a crucial first distance.

...

...

Now A. Allow. This is the step most people resist. Allowing does not mean approving, or liking, or wanting the emotion to stay. It means you stop fighting it for a moment. You let it be present without immediately trying to fix it, push it away, or numb it.

...

...

Whatever you recognized a moment ago, can you let it sit here with you without trying to change it? Not forever. Just for the next sixty seconds.

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

That is the hardest part for most people. We are trained to fix uncomfortable things immediately. But emotions are not problems to solve. They are information. And you cannot read information while you are busy trying to make it disappear.

...

...

Now I. Investigate. This is where things get interesting. Turn your attention toward the emotion with genuine curiosity. Where do you notice it in your body? Is it in your chest, your throat, your stomach, your jaw? Does it have a quality? Is it heavy, tight, hot, dull, sharp?

...

...

You are not thinking about the emotion. You are sensing it directly. Where it lives, what it is made of, how it behaves when you look at it closely.

...

...

Spend a minute with this now. Bring your attention to wherever you notice the emotion most strongly, and study it the way you would study something under a microscope.

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

What did you find? Many people discover that when they investigate an emotion directly, it shifts. It might soften, move, change temperature, or even dissolve. This is not because you are forcing it. It is because you are giving it the attention it was asking for.

...

...

...

And finally, N. Nurture. This is the step that distinguishes RAIN from mere observation. After you have recognized, allowed, and investigated the emotion, you offer yourself something kind.

...

This might be a hand on your chest. It might be a silent phrase like it is alright, I have got you. It might be nothing more than a softening of your attitude, a warmth toward yourself for being human enough to have emotions in the first place.

...

...

Try this now. Whatever you have been sitting with, offer it some gentleness. Not to make it go away, but because you have been brave enough to look at it, and that deserves acknowledgement.

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

RAIN is not a one-time exercise. It is a portable tool you can use anywhere. In a meeting, after an argument, lying awake at three in the morning when your mind will not quiet down. Four letters. Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Nurture.

...

...

For the remainder of this session, I am going to step back and let you sit with whatever is present. If an emotion is here, use RAIN. If nothing particular is here, just rest in that openness.

[SILENCE: 90]

...

...

...

Gently begin to notice the room around you. The sounds, the temperature, the surface beneath you.

...

Open your eyes when you are ready, and let yourself take a moment before you move.

...

...

Your homework is to use RAIN once today, on any emotion that shows up, however small. Irritation in a queue. A pang of loneliness. A flash of joy. Recognize it, allow it, investigate where it lives in your body, and then offer yourself something kind. Four steps, two minutes.

...

The weather changes. RAIN works in all conditions. See you tomorrow.
