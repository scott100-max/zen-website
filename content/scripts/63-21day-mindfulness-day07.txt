You know more than you did seven days ago.

...

That is not motivational talk. It is a fact. In the past six days, you have learned five distinct skills, and each one has a name you can use.

...

Today we are going to revisit each one, briefly, so they land in your memory as tools you can reach for whenever you need them. And then we are going to combine them.

...

...

Close your eyes, and take a moment to arrive wherever you are.

...

...

Skill one. Attention placement. You learned this on day one. You can choose where your attention goes, and you can bring it back when it wanders. The move is three words. Drift, notice, return.

...

Let us do this for thirty seconds. Pick any anchor at all, a sound, your breath, your hands, anything, and place your attention there. When it drifts, bring it back.

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

Skill two. Breath counting. Day two. You count your exhales from one to four and start again. It gives your mind just enough structure to stay grounded without locking it down.

...

Count four breath cycles right now. One, two, three, four. Then stop.

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

Skill three. Body awareness. Day three. You can bring fine-grained attention to any part of your body and notice what is actually there, not what you expect to find.

...

Pick one area right now, wherever your attention is drawn to. Spend thirty seconds there, noticing temperature, weight, texture, and anything else that reveals itself.

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

Skill four. Thought observation. Day four. Thoughts are events in your mind, not facts and not instructions. You can watch them arrive and leave without following any of them.

...

Watch for the next thought that shows up. Give it a one-word label, and let it pass.

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

Skill five. Layered listening. Day five. You can separate the soundscape into foreground, mid-ground, and background, and hold all three at once.

...

Do that now. Near, middle, far. All three layers at once.

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

And the meta-skill that runs underneath all of them. The pause. Day six. Between any stimulus and your response, there is a gap. You found it in the breath, in the body, and between thoughts. That gap is where your freedom to choose lives.

...

...

...

Now for the integration. You are going to practise all five skills in sequence, and then something new. You are going to let them all go and sit in open awareness, holding everything at once without choosing a specific anchor.

...

...

Start with sound. Hold the full soundscape for thirty seconds.

[SILENCE: 30]

...

Shift to the breath now, and count four full cycles in your own time.

[SILENCE: 45]

...

Move into the body. Hold your entire body in awareness at once, like a floodlight.

[SILENCE: 30]

...

Watch your thoughts for a moment. Notice what arrives.

[SILENCE: 20]

...

And now, let everything go. Do not choose an anchor. Do not direct your attention anywhere. Just sit here, aware, open, and let whatever comes, come.

...

...

This is what the next two weeks will build on. This wide, open quality of awareness where nothing is excluded and nothing is chased.

...

...

I am going to leave you in this open space now. Nothing to do, nothing to fix, nothing to follow. Just here.

[SILENCE: 120]

...

...

...

Gently begin to notice the room around you again. The sounds, the temperature, the light behind your eyelids.

...

...

Open your eyes when you are ready, and take a moment to appreciate what you have built this week.

...

...

Your homework today is five minutes, and it marks the end of your first week. At some point today, sit for five minutes and run through the five skills in any order you choose. Thirty seconds on each, then one full minute of open awareness at the end. That is the entire week, compressed into five minutes.

...

...

You have completed the foundation. Next week, we start working with what is difficult. See you on day eight.
