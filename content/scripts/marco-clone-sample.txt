Tonight, I am going to tell you a story.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

A quiet little story, about a cat called Monty.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

Monty is a ginger tabby. A big one. The kind of cat who takes up more of the sofa than seems fair.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

He has got copper-coloured fur that catches the light. Enormous golden eyes. And paws the size of small biscuits.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

His whiskers are long, and white, and slightly crooked on the left side. From an incident with a butterfly, that he would rather not discuss.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

Monty lives in a stone cottage, at the edge of a village. The kind of village where nothing much happens. And everyone likes it that way.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

He knows the warm spot on the kitchen windowsill, where the afternoon sun falls. He knows which fence posts are sturdy enough to walk along. And which ones wobble.
