Let your head rest gently on the pillow right now.
...
Tonight you are going to learn a technique that was developed almost a century ago by a German physician named Johannes Schultz. It is called autogenic training, and it works by giving your body a series of quiet instructions that guide your nervous system from wakefulness into rest.
...
The instructions are simple. You will direct your attention to different parts of your body and repeat a short phrase in your mind. The phrase will describe a sensation, heaviness or warmth, and your body will gradually begin to produce that sensation on its own.
...
This is not imagination. Autogenic training has been studied in clinical settings for decades. The mechanism is straightforward. When you focus your attention on a body part and suggest a specific sensation, your autonomic nervous system responds. Blood flow shifts. Muscle tension drops. Your body begins preparing itself for rest.
......
We will start with your right hand, because the hands are rich in nerve endings and respond quickly.
...
Bring your attention to your right hand. Not the idea of it, but the actual physical sensations in your palm, your fingers, the weight of it resting on the bed.
...
Now, silently in your mind, repeat this phrase. My right hand is heavy and warm. Say it slowly, as though you are reading it for the first time.
......
My right hand is heavy and warm. Let the words move through your awareness without forcing anything. You are not commanding your hand to change. You are suggesting a direction and letting your body decide what to do with it.
...
My right hand is heavy and warm. If you notice a subtle tingling, or a slight increase in warmth, that is the autonomic response beginning. If you notice nothing yet, that is fine. It builds over time.
......
Now let that warmth and heaviness spread across to your left hand. Same phrase, new focus. My left hand is heavy and warm.
...
Both hands resting on the bed, heavy as though they have sunk a few millimetres into the mattress. Warm as though you are holding a cup of something hot. My left hand is heavy and warm.
......
Now let the heaviness travel up from both hands, through your wrists, along your forearms, past your elbows, all the way up to your shoulders. A slow wave of weight, as though your arms are made of something denser than usual.
...
My arms are heavy and warm. The muscles along your biceps and forearms have nothing to do right now. Let them release whatever tension they have been holding. They will not need it until morning.
...
My arms are heavy and warm. Sinking further into the mattress beneath you.
......
Now bring your attention down to your right leg. Start at the foot. Notice the weight of it, the way it rests against the sheet.
...
My right leg is heavy and warm. From the sole of the foot, up through the ankle, the shin, the knee, the thigh. A warm heaviness moving slowly upwards, like honey spreading across the surface of a spoon.
......
And now your left leg. My left leg is heavy and warm. Both legs now resting with their full weight on the bed. The muscles along your calves and thighs softening, releasing, letting go of whatever they carried today.
...
My legs are heavy and warm. They do not need to support you right now. Let the bed take every ounce of their weight.
......
Now bring your attention to your torso. The broad muscles of your back, pressed against the mattress. Your stomach, your chest.
...
My body is heavy and warm. Notice the weight of your whole body sinking into the bed beneath you. Each breath out lets you sink a fraction lower.
...
There is nothing to hold up. Nothing to support. No tension that needs maintaining. Everything can come to rest.
......
Now bring your attention gently to your heartbeat. You do not need to find it immediately. Just wait, and eventually you will notice a faint pulse somewhere in your chest or your neck or your wrists.
...
My heartbeat is calm and steady. You are not trying to slow it down. You are noticing the rhythm that is already there and acknowledging it. My heartbeat is calm and steady.
......
Now your breathing. It has probably slowed on its own during this practice. Notice that. You did not need to force it.
...
My breathing is calm and effortless. Each inhale arrives when it is needed. Each exhale leaves when it is ready. You do not need to manage this process. Your body has been doing it without your help since the moment you were born.
......
The final instruction is one that Schultz considered the most important. Bring your attention to your forehead, the broad space between your eyebrows and your hairline.
...
My forehead is cool and calm. While the rest of your body is warm and heavy, your forehead is pleasantly cool, as though a gentle breeze is moving across it.
...
My forehead is cool and calm. This contrast, warm body and cool forehead, signals to your nervous system that it is time to let go of conscious thought and allow rest to arrive.
......
Now let all of the phrases merge into one quiet awareness. Your hands, heavy and warm. Your arms, heavy and warm. Your legs, sinking into the mattress. Your body, fully at rest. Your heartbeat, steady. Your breathing, effortless. Your forehead, cool and calm.
...
You do not need to hold onto any of these. They are happening on their own now. Your nervous system has received the instructions and it is carrying them out without your involvement.
......
Let your attention soften now. Let it blur at the edges, the way a landscape blurs when you look at it through rain on a window.
...
There is nothing left to do. Nothing to think about, nothing to remember, nothing to prepare for. The morning is a long way off and it will take care of itself.
...
Let the heaviness carry you. Let the warmth hold you. Let the quiet do the rest.
......
There is nothing left to do tonight. Goodnight from Salus.
