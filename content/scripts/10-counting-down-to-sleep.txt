Welcome to Salus. Tonight, we're going to use a simple technique to guide you into sleep. We're going to count. That's it. Nice and simple. We'll count breaths, count body parts relaxing, and count steps down into the deepest rest you've had in a long time.

...

Numbers have a rhythm to them. A predictability. And that's exactly what your brain needs right now — something steady and reliable and repetitive enough to let go of everything else. Counting gives your mind just enough to do that it stops doing all the other things. The worrying, the planning, the replaying. It all gets replaced by simple numbers. One after the other. Steady and calm.

...

So let's get started. Settle into your bed. Get comfortable. Pillow adjusted, covers pulled up, body in its favorite position. Take a moment. Shift around if you need to. There's no rush.

...

Close your eyes.

...

Take one deep breath in. Fill your lungs. Feel your chest and belly expand.

...

And let it out. All the way. Feel everything settle.

...

Good. Here we go.

...
...

We'll start by counting ten slow breaths. I'll count them with you. Your only job is to breathe and listen. Don't try to breathe perfectly. Don't try to match any particular rhythm. Just breathe naturally, and I'll count us through.

...

One. Breathe in slowly through your nose. Feel your lungs expand. Feel your belly rise gently. Feel the air cool against the inside of your nostrils.

...

And breathe out. Slowly. All the way out. Feel your body settle as the air leaves. Feel your shoulders drop slightly.

...

Two. In through the nose. A little deeper this time. Fill your chest. Fill your belly. Let the breath push gently outward in all directions.

...

And out. Long and slow. Feel your body settle a little more. A little heavier. A little more relaxed.

...

Three. Breathe in. Slow and smooth. Feel the cool air entering your nostrils, warming as it flows down your throat, filling your lungs with warmth and life.

...

And out. Warm air leaving. Tension leaving with it. The exhale is doing double duty — releasing air and releasing the day.

...

Four. In. Your breathing is getting slower already. Your body is recognizing what this is. It's a signal. A pattern. A permission.

...

And out. Slower still. The exhale is longer than the inhale now. That's your parasympathetic nervous system kicking in. That's your body saying, "Okay. I understand. We're resting now."

...

Five. Halfway. Breathe in. Deep and easy. You're getting good at this. There's nothing to it, really. Just air in and air out.

...

And out. Feel your shoulders drop a little more. Feel your jaw loosen. You might not have noticed it was tight, but it was. Let it go.

...

Six. In. Each breath is pulling you a little further from the surface of the day. A little deeper into quiet. Like walking down a gently sloping path, further from the noise.

...

And out. Let the air carry everything out. Stress. Thoughts. Tension. Worries. Let it all hitch a ride on the exhale.

...

Seven. Breathe in. Your body is heavier now. More relaxed. The bed feels softer beneath you. The pillow feels more cradling. Everything is more comfortable than it was seven breaths ago.

...

And out. Long, slow exhale. Like pouring water from a glass. Slowly. Smoothly. All the way to the bottom.

...

Eight. In. You're deep in the breathing now. The rhythm has taken over. You're not doing it anymore — it's doing you. The breathing is breathing you. You're just along for the ride.

...

And out. So slow. So easy. Like the world has slowed down to match your breathing, and not the other way around.

...

Nine. Breathe in. Almost there. Feel how different your body is now compared to when we started. Nine breaths ago, you were awake and thinking and carrying things. Now you're soft and heavy and quiet. That's the power of paying attention to something simple.

...

And out. Nearly all the tension is gone. Just the faintest traces remain, and we'll get those next.

...

Ten. One last deep breath in. The deepest one yet. Fill every corner of your lungs. Feel your ribcage stretch. Feel your belly rise all the way.

...

And let it all go. All of it. Every last molecule of air. Every last trace of effort. Out.

...
...

Good. Now let your breathing return to its own natural rhythm. You don't need to count it or control it anymore. It knows what to do. It's been doing this since the moment you were born. Trust it. Let it go.

...
...

Now we're going to count down through your body. We'll start at the top and work our way to the bottom, and with each number, a different part of you is going to let go completely. Like turning off lights in a building, floor by floor. By the time we reach one, the whole building will be dark and quiet and at rest.

...

Ten. Your scalp and forehead. Feel the skin of your forehead smooth out, as if a gentle hand is pressing the worry lines flat. The furrows from the day — from concentrating, from squinting, from thinking too hard — they disappear. Your scalp relaxes. The muscles at your temples soften. The skin feels looser. Wider. More spacious.

...

Nine. Your eyes and cheeks. Your eyelids are heavy — pleasantly heavy, like warm coins resting on your eyes. Behind them, your eyes have stopped moving. They're still. They're at peace. Your cheekbones relax. The muscles around your eyes — the ones that squint and crinkle — let go completely.

...

Eight. Your jaw and mouth. This is a big one. Let your jaw drop slightly. Really let it go. Your teeth part — there should be a gap between your upper and lower teeth. Your lips rest together softly, or maybe they part just slightly. Your tongue falls away from the roof of your mouth and lies heavy at the bottom, thick and still. No more words tonight. No more chewing. No more clenching. Your jaw is done.

...

Seven. Your neck and throat. Feel the tension drain out of the muscles on the sides of your neck — those ropy muscles that tighten when you're stressed or when you crane forward over a screen. They go soft now. Your throat opens. The muscles around your windpipe relax. Your head sinks deeper into the pillow. The pillow holds the full weight of your head, and your neck has nothing left to do.

...

Six. Your shoulders. They drop. Both of them, at the same time, falling toward the mattress like someone cut the strings that were holding them up. The space between your ears and shoulders grows wider. That gap — feel it widen. That's relaxation. That's letting go. That's your body saying "finally."

...

Five. Your arms and hands. Both arms go heavy at the same time. From shoulders to fingertips, everything softens. Your biceps, your forearms, your wrists — all the muscles that gripped and typed and carried and held things today — they're off. Done. Finished. Your hands open slightly, palms up or palms down, it doesn't matter. Every finger is loose and warm and heavy. You're not holding anything anymore.

...

Four. Your chest and upper back. Feel your ribcage settle. The muscles between your ribs go soft. Your chest becomes open and easy, rising and falling with each breath like a boat on calm water. Your upper back spreads against the mattress, wide and flat. The muscles between your shoulder blades — the ones that bunch from hunching over desks and phones — they release. They melt. Every breath is easy now. Every breath is effortless.

...

Three. Your stomach and lower back. Your belly is soft. Completely soft. No holding, no tightening, no sucking in. Just the gentle rise and fall of natural breathing. Your lower back sinks into the mattress. That chronic tightness, that arch, that deep-held tension — it releases. The curve flattens. Your spine is fully supported. The bed has your back, literally. Let it do its job.

...

Two. Your hips and thighs. Your pelvis is heavy. Your hip joints loosen — those deep sockets that work so hard all day. Your thighs, those big powerful muscles that carry you everywhere, finally let go. They're heavy and warm and sinking into the mattress. Dense and soft, like warm clay. They couldn't hold you up right now even if they wanted to. And they don't want to.

...

One. Your knees, calves, ankles, feet, and toes. All at once. Everything from the knees down goes soft and heavy. Your calves release — those muscles that keep you balanced, that absorb every step. Your ankles go limp. Your feet fall gently to the sides — that's the sign of complete relaxation. Your toes uncurl. Ten small surrenders. Done. All the way down. From ten to one. Top to bottom. Every part accounted for. Every part at rest.

...
...

Your entire body has been counted into relaxation. From ten to one, top to bottom, every part of you has been named and released. Named and let go.

...

Feel that. Feel the wholeness of it. Your body is one continuous wave of relaxation, from the crown of your head to the tips of your toes. Not a single muscle is working. Not a single joint is holding. Everything is soft and heavy and warm.

...
...

Now we're going to go deeper. We're going to count down a staircase.

...

Imagine you're standing at the top of a staircase. It's a beautiful staircase — wide, with thick carpet that's soft under your bare feet. Deep red, or maybe deep blue. Whatever color feels most calming to you. There's a smooth wooden banister on one side, polished to a warm glow.

...

The lighting is warm and low. Not dark — just gentle. Like candlelight. Like the last light of evening. It's comfortable. It's inviting.

...

Below you, at the bottom of the staircase, is a door. You can see it from here — a simple wooden door, warm and old and welcoming. Behind that door is the deepest, most peaceful rest you've ever experienced. Every night of perfect sleep you've ever had is behind that door. And we're going to walk down to it together.

...

Twenty steps. With each step, you'll go deeper. Heavier. More relaxed. More ready for sleep. Each step is a small surrender. A small permission. A small letting go.

...

Ready? Put your hand on the banister. Feel the smooth, warm wood under your palm.

...

Step twenty. You step down. The carpet is thick under your feet — your toes sink into it. You feel yourself getting slightly heavier. Like gravity just increased by a fraction.

...

Step nineteen. Another step down. The light is a little dimmer here. A little warmer. More golden. More intimate.

...

Step eighteen. Your eyelids are heavier with every step. Your body is heavier. The stairs are easy and gentle — no effort required.

...

Step seventeen. Deeper. With each step, the world above you gets further away. The noise, the light, the busyness of the day — it's all up there, and you're moving away from it. Down. Away.

...

Step sixteen. You can feel sleep pulling you gently. Not urgently. Not impatiently. Just a soft gravitational pull, like the moon pulling the tide. Gentle. Inevitable.

...

Step fifteen. The carpet is so soft. Your feet sink into it with each step. It's like walking on clouds. Each step is cushioned and warm and easy.

...

Step fourteen. The banister is smooth under your hand. Cool and solid and grounding. It guides you downward without you having to think about where to put your feet.

...

Step thirteen. Deeper still. Your thoughts are slowing down. They're coming less frequently now, and when they come, they're softer. Less sharp. Less demanding. More like clouds than like words. More like shapes than like thoughts.

...

Step twelve. You're settling into a rhythm. Step, settle, sink. Step, settle, sink. It's almost automatic now. Your body is moving on its own.

...

Step eleven. The light is very low now. Just a soft amber glow. Enough to see the next step ahead of you, and that's all you need. You don't need to see the whole staircase. Just the next step.

...

Step ten. Halfway there. You're so relaxed now that your legs are moving on their own. You're not even thinking about walking. It's just happening, the way breathing just happens.

...

Step nine. Everything is quiet. The only sound is the soft padding of your feet on the carpet. Not even that, really. More the feeling of your feet on the carpet than the sound. Everything else has gone silent.

...

Step eight. Deeper. Heavier. More peaceful. The door at the bottom is closer now. You can sense it even if you can't see it clearly in the dim light. You can feel what's behind it. Rest. Deep, perfect rest.

...

Step seven. Your breathing is very slow. Long, gentle breaths that seem to last forever. Each exhale takes you down another level. Each exhale is a step in itself.

...

Step six. The walls of the staircase are warm. The air is warm. Everything is warm and soft and safe. There is nothing here that can hurt you. Nothing here that wants anything from you. Just the stairs and the door and the rest that's waiting.

...

Step five. Five more steps. You can barely keep your eyes open — even in your imagination, your eyes want to close. Not that you need them. Your feet know the way. The banister knows the way. Gravity knows the way.

...

Step four. Almost there. The pull of sleep is stronger now. Gentle but insistent. Like a hand on your shoulder, guiding you forward, guiding you down. Not pushing. Guiding.

...

Step three. Three steps from the deepest rest you've ever felt. Your body is so heavy it barely feels like your own anymore. It's just weight and warmth and peace. Just a warm, heavy form being guided gently downward.

...

Step two. One more step after this. The door is right there. You can feel the peace radiating from behind it like heat from a fire. Like warmth from a hearth. It's pulling you toward it.

...

Step one. The last step. You're at the bottom. Your feet are on level ground. You're standing in front of the door. The carpet is thick beneath you. The air is warm around you.

...
...

Reach out. Feel the handle. It's cool and smooth — a round, brass handle, worn smooth by use. It fits your hand perfectly.

...

Turn it. Slowly. Feel the mechanism click softly.

...

Push the door open.

...
...

Behind the door is darkness. Not frightening darkness — welcoming darkness. The kind of darkness that your eyes have been craving all day. The kind you've been waiting for. Cool, complete, velvety darkness. The darkness of a deep, windowless room. The darkness of a cave. The darkness of sleep itself.

...

And within that darkness, there is quiet. Complete quiet. The deepest silence you've ever experienced. Not the absence of sound — the presence of peace. Not empty silence — full silence. Silence that holds you. Silence that cushions you. Silence that says, "You're here. You made it. You can rest now."

...

Step through the door.

...

Feel the darkness wrap around you like the softest blanket you've ever touched. Feel the silence fill your ears like warm water. Feel the peace soak into your skin, your muscles, your bones. Every cell in your body recognizes this place. Every cell says, "Yes. This. Finally."

...

The door closes softly behind you. Click. Gentle. Final.

...

And you are here. In the deepest place. The quietest place. The most restful place that exists. A place built entirely for sleep. A place with no demands, no expectations, no obligations. Just rest.

...
...

There's nothing to see here. Nothing to hear. Nothing to do. Nothing to think about. Nothing to plan or solve or figure out. Just rest. Pure, undiluted, perfect rest.

...

Let's count one last time. Just five. Each number will take you deeper into this rest. Deeper into the darkness. Deeper into the silence. Deeper into sleep.

...

Five. You're sinking. Slowly, gently sinking into something warm and soft and bottomless. Like sinking into a cloud. Like sinking into warm water. Like sinking into the most perfect, comfortable bed ever made.

...

Four. Deeper. The darkness is a blanket. The silence is a song — a song with no notes, just peace. Everything around you is peace. You are surrounded by peace.

...

Three. You might not hear me say two. That's okay. You don't need to. The counting will continue on its own, even if you're not listening. Your subconscious will carry you the rest of the way.

...

Two. So deep now. So far from everything. So far from the day and the noise and the light. Safe and warm and held. Held by the darkness. Held by the silence. Held by sleep itself.

...

One.

...
...
...

[gentle silence]

...
...
...

You've arrived. Wherever you are right now — asleep, almost asleep, drifting in that warm space between waking and dreaming — you're exactly where you need to be. You counted your way here. Breath by breath. Body part by body part. Step by step. Number by number. All the way down.

...

No more counting. No more steps. No more numbers. Just rest now. Deep, quiet, uninterrupted rest. The kind of rest that heals. The kind that restores. The kind that makes you new.

...

Goodnight from Salus. Sleep well.
