If you have chosen this session, something is on your mind.
...
That is a reasonable place to start. You do not need to name it or explain it. You just need to know that whatever you are carrying right now, the next fifteen minutes are designed to help you work with it rather than against it.
...
Before we begin any breathing or body work, I want to share something about anxiety that most people never learn. It might change how you relate to it.
...
Anxiety follows a curve. It rises, it peaks, and if you do not add fuel to it, it falls again on its own. Every single time. This is not a theory or a positive affirmation. It is how your nervous system is built.
...
When something triggers a stress response, your body releases adrenaline and cortisol. These chemicals produce the physical sensations you recognise as anxiety. The tight chest, the racing thoughts, the urge to move or escape. But these chemicals have a limited lifespan. They metabolise. They clear. The wave passes.
...
The problem is what we do during the wave. We think our way into it. We replay the trigger, rehearse worst-case outcomes, criticise ourselves for being anxious in the first place.
...
Each of those thoughts sends a fresh signal to the brain that danger is still present, and the brain responds by releasing more adrenaline. The wave that should have peaked and subsided gets extended, sometimes for hours.
......
So the practice tonight is not about making the anxiety go away. It is about not extending it. You are going to ride the curve, notice what it does in your body, and let your nervous system do what it already knows how to do.
......
Find a comfortable position. Sitting is better than lying down for this practice, because a small amount of physical alertness actually helps. But if sitting is not an option, lying down is fine.
...
Place your feet flat on the floor if you are sitting. Let your hands rest on your thighs, palms down. Let your shoulders drop a fraction from where they are.
...
Close your eyes, or lower your gaze to a spot on the floor ahead of you. Either one is fine.
......
Now, instead of trying to calm down, I want you to do something that might seem counterintuitive. I want you to notice what the anxiety actually is in your body right now.
...
Not the story behind it. Not the thoughts it is generating. The physical reality of it. Where is it? What shape does it have? What temperature is it?
...
For most people, anxiety concentrates in one of three places. The chest, the stomach, or the throat. Bring your attention to whichever area is most active right now.
......
Whatever you find there, I want you to stay with it. Not fight it, not breathe it away, not try to relax it. Just observe it, the way you might observe a weather system from a window. It is happening. It has a shape and a texture and an intensity. You can watch it without being it.
...
This is called interoceptive awareness. It means paying attention to the signals coming from inside your own body. Research consistently shows that people who practise this skill experience shorter anxiety episodes, because they stop interpreting physical sensations as evidence that something is wrong and start seeing them as information that their body is processing a response.
......
Notice the sensation now. Has it changed at all since you first turned your attention to it? It might have intensified briefly. That is normal. Attention can amplify a sensation before it settles. Keep watching.
...
Breathe at whatever pace is natural. You do not need to breathe more slowly or more deliberately. Just let the breath happen on its own and keep your attention on that spot where the anxiety lives in your body.
......
If your mind produces a worried thought, notice it and gently redirect your attention back to the physical sensation. The thought is just your brain trying to make sense of what the body is doing. It is commentary, not fact. You do not need to engage with the commentary right now.
...
Stay with the sensation. What is it doing? Is it pulsing, steady, shifting? Has the intensity changed? Has the shape changed? Has the temperature changed?
......
Let us sit with this for a longer stretch now. Your only task is to keep your attention on the physical sensation without adding to it. No story, no prediction, no judgement. Just the raw data of what your body is reporting.
[SILENCE: 60s]
Good. Whatever you noticed just now is useful. You may have found that the sensation shifted or softened slightly. You may have found that it stayed roughly the same. Either outcome is fine. The point was not to eliminate it but to observe it without making it worse.
...
Now I want to introduce one small adjustment to your breathing. Not a dramatic change, just a slight lengthening of the exhale. Breathe in for a count of four, and out for a count of six. The longer exhale activates your vagus nerve, which sends a direct signal to your brain that the threat has passed and the system can begin to stand down.
...
Breathe in, two, three, four. And out, two, three, four, five, six.
...
Again. In, two, three, four. And out, two, three, four, five, six. Let the exhale be smooth and unhurried, like air leaving a tyre very slowly.
...
Continue this pattern at your own pace now. Four in, six out. And as you do, keep a gentle awareness on that spot in your body where the anxiety was strongest.
[SILENCE: 40s]
Notice what has happened to the sensation. For most people, after a few minutes of observation combined with extended exhales, the intensity will have dropped noticeably. Not to zero, perhaps, but enough to demonstrate the principle. The wave is passing.
...
If it has not shifted much, that is also fine. Some anxiety episodes take longer to crest than others. The practice is the same regardless. Observe, do not add fuel, let the chemistry clear.
......
In the days ahead, the next time you notice anxiety building, you have a choice that you may not have had before. You can engage with the thoughts, or you can drop your attention down into the body and watch the physical wave instead.
...
The wave will peak. It will subside. It always does. Your only job is to not extend it.
......
For now, let the counting go. Let your breathing return to its own natural rhythm. Let your attention widen from that single point in your body to the room around you.
...
Notice the surface beneath you. Notice the temperature of the air. Notice any sounds that are present, near or far.
...
When you are ready, open your eyes gently. Take a moment before you move on to anything else.
...
Thank you for staying with that. It is not an easy practice, and you did it well.
