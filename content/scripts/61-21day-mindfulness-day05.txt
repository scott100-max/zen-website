...

What did you hear just now?

...

...

In those eight seconds of quiet, your ears were already working. Sounds were arriving, layering on top of each other, competing for your attention. But most of them never reached your conscious awareness.

...

Today you are going to train your ears the way you trained your eyes on day one. You are going to learn layered listening, the practice of separating the soundscape into distinct layers and holding them all at once.

...

...

This matters because sound is the sense you cannot switch off. Your eyes close, but your ears do not. Learning to listen with precision gives you an anchor that works in any environment, any situation, any position.

...

...

Close your eyes, and for the first few breaths, just notice whatever is loudest right now. The most obvious sound around you. Do not search for it, let it come to you.

...

...

[SILENCE: 15]

...

That is your foreground layer. The sound that dominates. Now let it recede slightly, and listen for what is behind it. A subtler sound, a quieter one, something you were not aware of a moment ago.

...

...

[SILENCE: 15]

...

...

Now listen for the farthest sound you can detect. The most distant thing your ears can reach. It might be traffic, wind, a plane, a voice from another room. Stretch your hearing as far as it will go.

...

...

[SILENCE: 15]

...

...

You are now holding three layers. Near, middle, and far. In sound ecology, these are called the foreground, the mid-ground, and the background. Every environment on earth has all three, and most people never notice more than one at a time.

...

...

For the next minute, try to hold all three layers in awareness simultaneously. Not switching between them, but hearing the whole thing at once, the way you would see an entire landscape rather than just one tree.

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

There is a particular quality of attention that comes from listening to everything at once. It is wide and receptive rather than pointed and searching. It does not grab at sounds. It lets them arrive.

...

This is the same quality of attention you will need for the more advanced practices later in this course. Open, spacious, and not trying to control anything.

...

...

...

Now try something different. Listen to the gaps between the sounds. Not the absence of noise, because there is always something, but the brief spaces where one sound fades and another has not yet begun.

...

...

This is harder than it appears. The mind wants to track the sounds themselves, not the spaces around them. But the gaps are where your attention becomes genuinely quiet.

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

Good. For the remainder of our time together, I am going to step back and let the sounds around you become your entire meditation. No breath focus, no body awareness. Just listening. Let whatever arrives, arrive.

[SILENCE: 90]

...

...

Gently let your attention soften, and begin to notice the rest of your body again. Your hands, your posture, the surface under you.

...

...

Open your eyes when you are ready, and give yourself a moment to adjust to having the visual world back.

...

...

Your homework takes two minutes. On your next walk, or even standing at a window, count how many separate layers of sound you can distinguish. Near, mid, far, and anything in between. Try to hear at least five distinct layers. You will be surprised how rich the soundscape becomes once you start paying attention.

...

Tomorrow, we learn the most powerful micro-skill in all of psychology. See you then.
