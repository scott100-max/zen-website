Welcome back to Salus.

Day Six. One more day after this and you'll have completed the whole course. But today is important — today we learn how to take mindfulness off the meditation cushion and into real life.

...

Here's the truth: the most important mindfulness practice isn't the ten minutes you spend with your eyes closed. It's the moments throughout your day when you remember to be present.

A minute of genuine presence while drinking your morning tea. A moment of full attention while talking to a friend. A pause to feel your feet on the ground before a meeting.

These small moments of mindfulness matter more than any formal practice, because this is where your life actually happens.

...

Today we'll practise what I call "everyday mindfulness" — bringing full attention to ordinary activities.

Let's start with something we all do every day: breathing and listening. Then we'll talk about how to extend this to anything.

...

Find a comfortable seated position.

...

Close your eyes.

...

Take a few settling breaths.

...

...

Now, instead of focusing just on the breath, let's expand to include sound. Open your awareness to whatever sounds are present — near or far, pleasant or unpleasant.

...

You don't need to label the sounds or think about what's making them. Just hear them. Let them come to you.

...

...

...

Notice sounds you might normally filter out. The hum of an appliance. Distant traffic. Birds. Your own breathing.

...

...

...

Let the sounds wash over you. You're not reaching for them or pushing them away. You're just receiving.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Now, narrow your focus back to just the breath. Feel the rhythm of inhaling and exhaling.

...

...

And expand again to include sound.

...

...

This ability to focus and expand, to zoom in and zoom out — this is attentional flexibility. It's what mindfulness trains.

...

...

...

...

Now, let's apply this to everyday life. I'm going to guide you through an activity you probably do every day: drinking.

Imagine you're holding a cup of tea or coffee or water. We'll do this slowly, as a meditation.

...

First, feel the cup in your hands. The weight of it. The temperature — warm or cool. The texture of the surface.

...

Before you drink, notice the smell. Bring the cup near your nose. What do you notice?

...

Now, bring it to your lips. Feel the rim of the cup. Feel the anticipation.

...

Take a small sip. But don't swallow right away. Hold the liquid in your mouth for a moment. Notice the temperature, the texture, the taste. Where do you taste it on your tongue?

...

Now swallow. Feel the liquid moving down your throat, into your body.

...

Set the cup down. Feel your hands release it.

...

That's it. That's mindful drinking. One sip, fully experienced, is worth more than a whole pot consumed mindlessly.

...

...

...

You can do this with anything.

Mindful eating — feeling the food, chewing slowly, tasting each bite.

Mindful showering — feeling the water on your skin, the temperature, the sensations.

Mindful washing up — feeling the warm water, the soap, the textures.

...

Any activity can become a meditation when you bring full attention to it.

...

...

...

Let's end with a few breaths in open awareness. Eyes still closed. Just being present. Breath, body, sounds, sensations — all of it at once.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Take a deeper breath in.

...

And exhale.

...

Today's invitation is practical: pick one ordinary activity today — brushing your teeth, making your bed, eating a meal — and do it mindfully. Fully present. See what you notice that you normally miss.

...

Gently open your eyes.

...

Day Six — complete. Tomorrow is Day Seven — the final day. We'll bring everything together. See you then.

Thanks for practising with Salus.
