Today we're going to do a body scan meditation. This is one of the foundational practices in mindfulness, and it's beautifully simple. We're going to move our attention slowly through each part of the body, just noticing what's there. Not trying to fix anything. Not trying to relax — though relaxation often happens as a side effect. We're just paying attention.

So find a comfortable position. For this practice, lying down works really well if that's an option for you. On your back, arms resting at your sides, legs uncrossed. But sitting is perfectly fine too. Whatever lets you be comfortable without falling asleep — though if you do fall asleep, that's okay. It just means you needed the rest.

Let your eyes close.

...

Take a deep breath in.

...

And a slow breath out.

...

One more. Breathe in, feeling your body expand.

...

And breathe out, letting yourself settle into the surface beneath you.

...

Feel the weight of your body. Wherever you're resting — the chair, the bed, the floor — feel the points of contact. Notice how gravity holds you. You don't need to hold yourself up right now. You can let go of that effort.

...

...

Now, bring your attention down to your feet. Start with the toes on your left foot.

Can you feel them? There might be tingling, warmth, coolness. There might be nothing at all — and that's fine too. Just notice whatever is there.

...

Expand your awareness to the sole of your left foot. The arch. The heel.

...

Notice any sensations. Pressure from the surface beneath you. The fabric of a sock. A pulse of warmth. Or maybe just a kind of blankness. All of it is okay. We're not looking for anything in particular.

...

...

Now move your attention to your left ankle and lower leg. The shin. The calf. Notice the sensations in this area.

...

...

The left knee. Just rest your attention here for a moment.

...

And up into the left thigh. The front. The back. The whole upper leg.

...

...

Now let your attention shift to your right foot. Starting again with the toes. Notice whatever sensations are present.

...

The sole of the right foot. The heel.

...

...

Right ankle. Lower leg. Shin and calf.

...

...

Right knee.

...

Right thigh. The whole upper leg.

...

...

Now bring your awareness to both legs together, from the hips all the way down to the toes. Just holding this whole area in your attention for a moment.

...

...

Let your attention rise to the pelvis and hips. Notice the weight here, the contact with whatever you're resting on.

...

...

Move into the lower belly. This is an area where many of us hold tension without realising it. You don't need to do anything about the tension if it's there. Just notice it.

...

...

The lower back. Feel whatever is present. Tightness, openness, warmth, discomfort. No judgment. Just observation.

...

...

Now bring your attention to the upper belly. The area around your stomach, your solar plexus. You might notice the movement of your breath here — a gentle rise and fall.

...

...

The mid-back and the sides of your torso. Your ribs expanding and contracting with each breath.

...

...

Move your attention to your chest. Notice your heartbeat if you can feel it. The rhythm of your breathing.

...

...

The upper back, between your shoulder blades. This is another common area for tension. If you find some, just acknowledge it. Hello, tension. I see you.

...

...

Now bring your awareness to both shoulders. Notice if they're creeping up toward your ears. If they are, you can let them drop — but you don't have to. Just notice.

...

...

Let your attention flow down your left arm. The upper arm. The elbow. The forearm.

...

The left wrist. The palm of the left hand. Each finger.

...

...

And now the right arm. Upper arm. Elbow. Forearm.

...

Right wrist. The palm. Each finger.

...

...

Bring your attention to your neck. The front of the throat. The sides. The back of the neck.

...

...

Move to your jaw. This is one of the most common places people hold stress. You might notice clenching. If so, just notice it. You can soften the jaw if you'd like — let the teeth part slightly, let the tongue rest on the roof of the mouth.

...

Your lips. Your cheeks.

...

Your nose. The air flowing in and out.

...

Your eyes, resting behind closed lids.

...

Your forehead. Notice if there's any furrowing. Any holding.

...

The temples. The ears.

...

The top of your head. The crown.

...

...

Now, expand your awareness to your entire body, all at once. From the crown of your head to the tips of your toes. Hold your whole body in your attention.

...

...

Feel yourself as a complete, whole being. Breathing. Present. Alive in this moment.

...

...

...

Notice if there are areas that feel comfortable, at ease. And areas that feel tense or uncomfortable. Just notice the landscape of sensation without needing to change any of it.

...

...

...

Take a moment to appreciate what your body does for you. Every day, without you asking, it breathes, it digests, it heals, it carries you through the world. This practice of paying attention is a small way of saying thank you.

...

...

Now, let your awareness gently return to the breath. Feel the rise and fall.

...

...

Begin to bring some movement back. You might wiggle your fingers and toes.

...

Maybe roll your wrists or ankles.

...

Take a deep breath in — a full, satisfying inhale.

...

And breathe out completely.

...

And when you're ready, gently open your eyes. Take your time. There's no rush.

...

That's a body scan. You can do this any time — before bed, during a lunch break, when you're feeling disconnected from your body. It's a practice of coming home to yourself, one body part at a time.

Thanks for being here. I'll see you next time on Salus.
