You have lived in your body your whole life.

...

And yet most of it is a stranger to you. When was the last time you paid real attention to the soles of your feet, or the muscles along your ribs, or the space behind your eyes?

...

...

Today you are going to visit. Slowly, carefully, and with genuine curiosity. This is a body scan, but not the kind where someone names body parts in order and tells you to relax them.

...

This is about resolution. Like adjusting a lens from blurry to sharp, you are going to bring each area into focus and see what is actually there.

...

...

Lie down if you can. If not, sit comfortably and let your body be as supported as possible. The less effort you spend holding yourself up, the more attention you have available.

...

...

Let your eyes close, and take two or three breaths at whatever pace suits you right now.

...

...

We are going to start at the top of your head. Not because there is anything special about starting there, but because it gives your attention a clear beginning.

...

Bring your awareness to the very top of your skull. The crown. Most people have never paid this area any attention at all. Just notice what is there. Warmth, tingling, pressure, nothing at all. Whatever you find is fine.

...

...

[SILENCE: 15]

Now let your attention slide down to your forehead. Notice the skin there. Notice whether your forehead is smooth or slightly furrowed. You do not need to change it. Just see it clearly.

...

...

Move down to the muscles around your eyes. This is where people store more tension than they realise. The small muscles that squint, that focus, that hold your eyes shut. Notice their state right now.

...

...

Your jaw. The joint just in front of your ears. Is it clenched, or is there a gap between your upper and lower teeth? Again, no need to fix anything. You are making a map, not doing repairs.

...

...

[SILENCE: 10]

...

Now bring your attention to your throat and neck. There are muscles here that carry the full weight of your head all day long. Notice what they are doing right now. Gripping, holding, or perhaps already letting go.

...

...

Down into your shoulders. These are the headline act of tension for most people. Notice not just whether they are high or low, but the quality of the holding. Is it sharp or dull, tight or merely dense?

...

...

[SILENCE: 15]

...

Your arms now, from the shoulders down to the tips of your fingers. Let your attention travel along the full length of each arm. Not quickly, but at a pace that lets you notice things you would normally miss.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 15]

...

Now bring your awareness to your chest. Notice the movement of your ribcage as you breathe. The expansion, the release. Notice the area around your heart, whatever sensation lives there right now.

...

...

Your belly. The muscles of your abdomen. For many people this is a place of chronic holding, a place that never fully lets go. Notice what you find here without trying to change it.

...

...

[SILENCE: 15]

...

Move your attention down into your hips and pelvis. These are large, dense structures that often hold old tension. Just bring awareness here the way you would bring a torch into a room you have not visited in a long time.

...

...

Down through your upper legs. Your thighs. Heavy muscle that works hard all day and rarely gets acknowledged. Notice the weight of them against whatever is beneath you.

...

...

Your knees. The backs of your knees. Your shins and calves. Let your attention travel slowly, noticing whatever is present. Warmth, coolness, heaviness, lightness, nothing at all.

...

...

[SILENCE: 10]

...

And finally your feet. The arches, the toes, the soles. The very bottom of your body. Bring the same curiosity here that you brought to the top of your head.

...

...

[SILENCE: 15]

...

...

Now do something different. Instead of focusing on one part at a time, try to hold your entire body in awareness at once. The whole thing, from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet. Not scanning, but holding.

...

...

...

This is a different skill from focused attention. Yesterday you practised pointing your attention like a torch. Right now you are practising making it a floodlight. Both are useful. Both are trainable.

...

...

Stay here, holding the whole body at once, for the next little while. I will come back to you soon.

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

Gently begin to move your fingers and toes if you would like. There is no rush. Let the body wake back up at its own pace.

...

...

When you are ready, open your eyes and let the world come back gradually.

...

...

Your homework is one minute. At some point today, pick a single body part, any one you like, and spend sixty seconds giving it your full attention. See how much detail you can notice. That is it. One part, one minute.

...

The map gets more detailed every time you visit. See you tomorrow.
