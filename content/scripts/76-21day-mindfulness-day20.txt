You know what to do.

...

For nineteen days, you have been learning techniques, building skills, and following instructions. Today, you need almost none of that.

...

...

Today is the long sit. Forty minutes, with very little guidance from me. This is not a test. It is a graduation exercise. You have all the tools you need. Now you get to discover what happens when you use them on your own terms.

...

...

...

The long sit is a cornerstone of every serious contemplative tradition. Zen calls it zazen. Vipassana retreats build entire days around it. The reason it matters is that something happens around the twenty-minute mark that does not happen in shorter sessions. The mind goes through a predictable sequence.

...

...

For the first five to ten minutes, it settles. Thoughts slow down, the body adjusts, attention stabilises. In the middle section, from ten to twenty-five minutes, it gets restless. Boredom arrives. The urge to check the time, to move, to stop. This is the zone where most people quit.

...

...

But if you stay, something changes. After the restlessness peaks, the mind often drops into a quieter state on its own. Not through effort, but through persistence. The noise clears, and what is left is a spacious, open awareness that does not need maintaining. It just is.

...

...

...

Today, your only instruction is to sit through all three phases. Arrive. Get restless. And stay.

...

...

Close your eyes whenever you are ready, and choose any anchor you like to begin with. Breath, body, sound, or no anchor at all. You have practised all of them. Choose whatever suits you today.

...

...

...

I am going to speak very little from here on. A few quiet check-ins along the way, and that is all. This is your session.

...

If you are still here, you are doing exactly what you need to do. Whatever your mind is doing right now, whether it is calm or chaotic, is part of the process. Stay.

...

...

[SILENCE: 300]

...

...

The restlessness, if it has arrived, is not a sign that you are doing it wrong. It is a sign that you are doing it right. This is the pass. Everyone encounters it. The only way through is to stay seated and let it exhaust itself.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 300]

...

...

...

If something has shifted, if a quieter state has arrived on its own, rest in it. If the restlessness is still here, that is also fine. The practice is the sitting, not the state.

...

...

[SILENCE: 300]

...

...

...

...

You have been sitting for a long time. Let that register. This is not something most people ever do. Forty minutes of choosing to stay present, through boredom, through restlessness, through whatever your mind produced. That is genuine practice.

...

...

...

Gently begin to notice the room around you. Let the sounds arrive. Let your body announce itself. The weight, the warmth, the contact with the surface beneath you.

...

...

...

Take your time. After a long sit, there is no reason to rush back into motion.

...

...

Open your eyes when you are ready, and let the world come back at whatever speed it wants to.

...

...

...

There is no homework tonight. Tomorrow is our last session together. The final day. Be there.
