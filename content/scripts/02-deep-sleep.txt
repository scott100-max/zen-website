Welcome to Salus. Tonight, there's nothing you need to do. Nowhere to be. Nothing to figure out. This time is yours — and all you need to do is listen and let go.

Settle into your bed. Adjust your pillow. Pull the covers up. Let your body find its most comfortable position.

Close your eyes. Take a slow, deep breath in... hold it gently... and release it all the way out.

We're going to release the tension your body has been carrying today. Starting at the top of your head.

Feel the muscles in your forehead. Smooth them out. Let your eyebrows drop. Release your jaw — let your lips part slightly. Your tongue rests softly behind your teeth.

Let your neck soften. Feel the weight of your head sinking into the pillow. Your shoulders drop away from your ears... melting downward... heavy and warm.

Your arms grow heavy. Your hands uncurl. Each finger releases, one by one.

Feel your chest soften. Your stomach rises and falls gently. There's no effort here — just the natural rhythm of your body breathing itself.

Your hips relax. Your thighs grow heavy. Your calves... your ankles... your feet. Everything is sinking. Softening. Letting go.

Now, simply rest your attention on your breathing. You don't need to change it. Just notice the gentle rise... and fall.

With each exhale, you sink a little deeper. The bed holds you. The darkness is soft and welcoming.

If thoughts come — and they will — imagine them as clouds drifting across a night sky. You see them. You let them pass. They don't need anything from you right now.

Just breathing. Just resting. You're safe.

Imagine you're lying on a quiet beach at night. The sand is soft and warm beneath you. The air is still. Above you, a sky full of stars stretches in every direction.

You can hear the ocean. Gentle waves roll in... pause... and pull softly back. In... and out. Each wave carries away a little more of the day. A little more of the noise.

The water never reaches you. It just whispers nearby. A steady, ancient rhythm that your body recognizes. A rhythm that says: rest now. Everything is taken care of.

The stars above you pulse gently. One by one, they seem to dim — not disappearing, just softening. The way a candle glows quieter as the night deepens.

You feel yourself becoming lighter. As if the sand is slowly cradling you... drawing you into its warmth. Your edges blur. The boundary between you and the night begins to dissolve.

The waves continue. In... and out.

There's nothing left to hold onto. And that feels good. That feels like freedom.

Just the waves.

Just the breath.

You're drifting now. Let it happen.

Sleep is coming to meet you. You don't need to go anywhere. Just stay here... breathing... resting.

Everything is quiet. Everything is well.

Goodnight.
