Welcome to Salus.

Today's practice is called open awareness, and it's one of my favourites. We're going to start with a narrow focus — the breath — and then gradually widen the lens until we're holding everything in our awareness at once. Sounds, sensations, thoughts, emotions — all of it. Not clinging to any one thing. Just being present with whatever arises.

This is sometimes called choiceless awareness, and it's one of the more advanced mindfulness practices. But don't let that intimidate you. If you can sit and notice, you can do this. It just takes a willingness to let go of control and see what happens.

Find a comfortable seated position. Upright, but relaxed. Let your eyes close.

...

Take three deep breaths to settle in.

Breathe in fully.

...

Breathe out completely.

...

In.

...

Out.

...

One more. Deep in.

...

And slowly out. Let your breathing return to its natural rhythm.

...

...

We'll start where we often start — with the breath. Let your attention rest on the sensation of breathing. Wherever you feel it most clearly. The nostrils. The chest. The belly. Just follow the rhythm for a few minutes.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Good. Now, without leaving the breath entirely, let's widen the circle of awareness to include your body. Feel the breath, but also notice the sensations in your body. The weight of yourself in the chair or on the cushion. The temperature of the air on your skin. Any areas of tension. Any areas of ease.

You're not scanning systematically — you're just opening the door and letting your body be part of what you're aware of. The breath is still there, but now it's one thing among several.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Now, widen the circle again. This time, let sounds in. Don't go looking for them — let them come to you. The hum of a heater. Traffic in the distance. Birds. A voice somewhere. The silence between sounds.

Notice how sounds arise, exist for a moment, and pass away. You don't need to identify or label them. Just let them be part of your awareness. Breath, body, and sound — all held together.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Some sounds might be pleasant. Others might be irritating. Notice if you're adding a judgment — "I like that sound," "I don't like that one." That judgment is just another event in awareness. Notice it and let it be.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Now, widen one more time. Let thoughts and emotions into the field of awareness. This is the trickiest part, because it's easy to get pulled into thinking rather than just noticing thinking. But see if you can treat thoughts the way you treated sounds — as events that arise and pass.

A thought appears. You notice it. It fades. An emotion surfaces. You feel it in your body. It shifts.

You're not trying to think or not think. You're not trying to feel or not feel. You're just aware.

...

...

...

...

...

...

This is open awareness. Everything is welcome. Nothing is pushed away. Nothing is clung to. You're like a vast, open space — and within that space, experiences come and go.

Breath rises and falls.

...

Sensations pulse and shift.

...

Sounds appear and dissolve.

...

Thoughts flicker and fade.

...

And you are the awareness that holds it all.

...

...

...

...

If you find yourself getting caught up in something — a worry, a sensation, a sound — that's completely fine. Just notice that you got narrowed down, and gently open back up. Widen the lens again. Return to the spaciousness.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

There's something deeply restful about this practice. When you stop trying to control your attention, when you stop bracing against what's arising, when you just allow — there's a kind of ease that's hard to describe. You're not working anymore. You're just being.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

You might notice that your awareness naturally gravitates toward certain things. Maybe sounds keep pulling you. Maybe physical sensations are louder today. That's fine. Let your awareness be drawn wherever it goes, and then gently come back to the openness. The wide view. The full picture.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Notice the quality of this moment. Right now. Not the moment you're hoping for or the moment you just had. This one. What does it contain?

...

...

...

...

This is what it means to be present. Not forcing a feeling. Not achieving a state. Just being fully here for whatever this moment actually is.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Let's begin to bring this practice to a close. Not abruptly — gently. Let your awareness start to narrow back down. Let thoughts and emotions recede to the background.

...

Let sounds become softer in your attention.

...

Let bodily sensations settle.

...

And come back to the breath. Just the simple rhythm of breathing. In. Out. In. Out. Your anchor. Your home base.

...

...

...

...

Take a deeper breath in.

...

And a long, slow breath out.

...

Begin to notice the room around you. The light. The temperature. The surface beneath you.

...

Wiggle your fingers and toes.

...

And when you feel ready, gently open your eyes.

...

...

Open awareness is a practice you can carry off the cushion. In any moment of your day, you can pause, widen the lens, and just notice what's here. The fullness of your experience, right now. It doesn't take long. It just takes willingness.

Thank you for being here today. I'll see you next time on Salus. Take care of yourself.
