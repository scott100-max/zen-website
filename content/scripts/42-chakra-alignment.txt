CHAKRA ALIGNMENT
Duration: 35 minutes
Style: Warm, grounded male narrator

Today we're going to work with the chakra system — a traditional framework for understanding energy, awareness, and vitality in the body. The chakras are seven centres that run from the base of your spine to the crown of your head, each associated with different qualities, colours, and aspects of your physical and emotional experience.

Now, I want to be straightforward about this. Whether you think of chakras as literal energy centres, as metaphors for different dimensions of human experience, or simply as a useful map for body awareness — the practice works the same way. This is fundamentally an exercise in directed attention and visualisation, using a framework that yogic traditions have been refining for thousands of years. You don't need to adopt any particular belief system. You just need to be willing to focus, to visualise, and to pay close attention to what you feel.

What I can tell you is that this practice — regardless of how you interpret its underlying framework — tends to produce a deep sense of wholeness and integration. You're going to give careful, sustained attention to every region of your body, from root to crown. That alone is powerful.

This session is best done sitting upright, so that your spine is vertical and the path from base to crown is clear. A chair is fine. A cushion is fine. If you need to lie down, that works too — just imagine the same vertical alignment running through you.

...

Let's settle in. Close your eyes. Take a deep, full breath in.

...

And exhale slowly, completely.

...

Again. Inhale — feel your spine lengthening, your posture straightening. As though someone is gently drawing you upward by a thread at the crown of your head.

...

Exhale — feel your body settling, your weight dropping. Grounded below, lifted above.

...

One more. Breathe in fully.

...

And release.

...

...

Good. Let your breath return to its natural rhythm. Spend a moment just being aware of your body as a whole. The physical structure of you, sitting here. The skeleton, the muscles, the organs, the skin. And within all of it, a subtle aliveness — a hum, a vibration, a warmth. The felt sense of being a living body.

...

...

...

Now, we'll begin our journey at the base and move upward. At each chakra, I'll guide you through a visualisation and an inquiry. Take your time at each one. There's no rush. We're building something as we go.

...

...

--- ROOT CHAKRA: MULADHARA ---

Bring your attention to the very base of your spine. The perineum. The sitting bones. The root of your body — the point where you contact the earth, or the chair, or the cushion beneath you.

...

This is Muladhara. The root chakra. It's associated with the colour red — a deep, rich, earthy red — and with your most fundamental sense of safety, stability, security, and belonging. It governs your relationship with the physical world. Your sense of having a right to be here. To take up space. To exist.

...

Imagine a warm, glowing sphere of deep red light at the base of your spine. It doesn't need to be vivid or photographic — just a sense of red warmth in that area. A glow. A presence.

...

...

Feel this centre pulsing gently. Like a heartbeat low in your body. Feel it connecting you to the ground beneath you. To the earth itself. To the basic, primal, animal sense of being safe, being grounded, being held by something solid and reliable.

...

...

As you breathe, imagine each inhale feeding this red glow. Drawing energy up from the earth through the base of your body. Each breath makes the light a little brighter, a little warmer, a little more steady.

...

...

...

...

Ask yourself quietly: do I feel grounded right now? Do I feel safe? Do I feel like I belong here, in this body, in this life?

You don't need to answer. You don't need to fix anything. Just notice what comes up. Whatever arises — security, anxiety, steadiness, fear — just acknowledge it. Bathe it in red light.

...

...

...

...

Let the red light settle into a steady, warm glow. Stable. Rooted. We'll leave it here, burning quietly, as we move upward.

...

...

--- SACRAL CHAKRA: SVADHISTHANA ---

Move your attention up to just below your navel. The lower belly. The pelvis. The bowl of the hips. This is Svadhisthana — the sacral chakra. Its colour is orange — warm, alive, like a sunset or embers — and it's associated with creativity, pleasure, emotional fluidity, desire, and your capacity to feel.

...

Visualise a sphere of warm orange light here. Glowing in your lower abdomen, just below the navel. Like a small sun, radiating warmth through your pelvis and hips.

...

...

Water is this chakra's element. It governs flow — the flow of emotions, of creative energy, of pleasure, of connection with others. When it's open and balanced, there's a sense of ease, of being in your body, of being comfortable with feeling things fully.

...

Notice any sensations in this area right now. Warmth, movement, tightness, numbness, openness. Whatever's there, just observe it without judgement.

...

...

Breathe into this orange glow. Let each inhale expand it. Imagine it softening any tension in your lower belly, your hips, your pelvis. These areas hold a lot — grief, pleasure, trauma, desire — often unconsciously. You don't need to process anything. Just let the light do its work.

...

...

...

...

This chakra asks: can you allow yourself to feel? Can you allow pleasure? Can you allow creativity? Can you let things flow?

...

...

...

Let the orange light glow steadily. Warm. Fluid. Alive.

...

...

--- SOLAR PLEXUS CHAKRA: MANIPURA ---

Move upward now to the solar plexus — the area just above your navel and below your ribcage. The pit of the stomach. This is Manipura. Its colour is yellow — bright, strong, radiant, like sunlight — and it's your centre of personal power, confidence, will, agency, and self-determination.

...

Visualise a bright yellow sphere of light here. Like a small sun burning in your core, radiating warmth and energy outward through your torso.

...

...

Fire is this chakra's element. This is the place where you feel your gut instincts. Where determination lives. Where you feel that fire in the belly when something matters to you, when you're ready to act, when you know what you want.

...

...

Breathe into this yellow light. Feel it grow with each inhale. Feel it radiate heat and confidence. A furnace at your centre.

...

...

...

...

Notice how this area feels right now. Is there strength here? Anxiety? Butterflies? Tightness? Emptiness? This area is sensitive to stress, to fear, to doubt — and also to excitement, to readiness, to power.

Whatever you find, just acknowledge it. Bathe it in golden light.

...

...

...

You are capable. You have will. You have the power to act, to choose, to create your life. Let this centre remind you of that.

...

...

...

Let the yellow light burn brightly. Confident. Strong. Clear.

...

...

--- HEART CHAKRA: ANAHATA ---

Now move your attention to the centre of your chest. The heart space. This is Anahata — the heart chakra — and it is, in many traditions, considered the most important of all. Its colour is green — rich, emerald, living green — and it governs love, compassion, connection, forgiveness, empathy, and your capacity to give and receive freely.

...

Visualise a sphere of luminous green light at the centre of your chest. Warm. Open. Expansive. Pulsing gently with each heartbeat.

...

...

...

Air is this chakra's element. And the heart chakra is the bridge — the centre point between the three lower chakras, which deal with the physical, the emotional, and the personal, and the three upper chakras, which deal with expression, intuition, and the transcendent. The heart connects them all. The heart holds everything together.

...

Breathe deeply into your chest. Feel it expand. Feel the green light growing with each breath, radiating outward from the centre in every direction — forward, backward, up, down, left, right. Like a sphere of warmth expanding from your heart.

...

...

...

...

Think of someone you love. It might be a partner, a child, a parent, a friend, an animal. Someone who fills your heart with warmth just by existing. Let that feeling rise. Let it fill your chest.

...

...

That warmth, that tenderness — that's this centre activating. That's the heart chakra doing what it does naturally, when we let it.

...

...

...

Now, gently, extend that same warmth toward yourself. This is often harder. But try. You deserve the same compassion you so readily offer to others. Can you turn that green light inward? Can you hold yourself the way you'd hold someone you love?

...

...

...

...

If there's anything in your heart that needs forgiveness — of yourself, of someone else — let the green light touch it. You don't have to resolve it now. Just let the light be there.

...

...

...

Let the green light glow openly. Expansive. Warm. Without walls.

...

...

--- THROAT CHAKRA: VISHUDDHA ---

Move upward to the throat. The base of the neck, the area around the vocal cords, the hollow at the front of the throat. This is Vishuddha — the throat chakra. Its colour is a clear, bright blue — like a cloudless sky — and it governs communication, expression, truth, authenticity, and your ability to speak and be heard.

...

Visualise a sphere of bright blue light at your throat. Cool and clear. Luminous.

...

...

Ether — space itself — is this chakra's element. The throat is where inner experience becomes outer expression. Where thoughts become words. Where feelings become voiced.

...

Swallow gently. Notice any tightness or openness in your throat. Many people hold tension here unconsciously — the words they haven't said, the truths they've swallowed, the emotions they've held back. What's here for you right now?

...

...

...

Breathe into this blue light. Imagine it clearing away any blockage, any constriction. Like a cool breeze moving through a narrow passage, opening it, widening it, making space.

...

...

...

...

This is your centre of authentic expression. When it's open, you speak your truth with clarity and kindness. You listen deeply. You communicate with integrity. You say what needs to be said, and you let go of what doesn't.

...

...

...

Let the blue light hum gently at your throat. Clear. Open. Vibrating with the potential of every word you might speak.

...

...

--- THIRD EYE CHAKRA: AJNA ---

Move your attention now to the space between your eyebrows. The centre of your forehead, slightly above the brow line. This is Ajna — the third eye chakra. Its colour is indigo — a deep, rich blue-violet, like the sky at twilight — and it's your centre of intuition, insight, imagination, and inner knowing.

...

Visualise a sphere of deep indigo light at the point between your brows. Luminous in its darkness, like a deep pool of knowing.

...

...

...

This is the seat of your inner vision. Not physical seeing, but the capacity to perceive beyond the surface. To understand patterns. To trust your instincts. To see clearly even when the situation is complex or uncertain.

...

Breathe into this indigo glow. Feel it pulsing gently. You might notice a slight pressure, tingling, or warmth between your eyebrows. That's normal and common.

...

...

...

...

This chakra asks: do you trust your own knowing? Do you trust what you sense beneath the noise of the analytical mind? There is wisdom in you that doesn't come from thinking. It comes from a deeper source — from the accumulated knowledge of a lifetime of experience, processed below the level of conscious thought.

...

...

...

...

Let the indigo light settle. Deep. Still. Seeing what the eyes cannot.

...

...

--- CROWN CHAKRA: SAHASRARA ---

And finally, bring your attention to the very top of your head. The crown. Sahasrara. Its colour is violet — luminous, ethereal, sometimes depicted as white or gold — and it represents your connection to something larger than yourself. To the whole. To consciousness itself. To whatever word you use for the vastness that contains you.

...

Visualise a sphere of radiant violet light at the crown of your head. Soft, glowing, open upward.

...

...

...

This isn't about religion. It's not about belief in any particular deity or metaphysical system. It's about the simple, felt recognition that you are part of something immense. That your awareness doesn't stop at the boundaries of your skull. That you are connected — to other people, to the natural world, to the living fabric of existence.

...

Breathe into this violet light. Feel it open like a lotus flower at the top of your head. Radiating upward. Connecting you to the sky, to space, to the infinite field of awareness that holds everything.

...

...

...

...

...

Let this crown centre glow. Open. Radiant. Humble and vast at the same time.

...

...

...

--- FULL ALIGNMENT ---

Now, hold all seven centres in your awareness simultaneously. This is the alignment. This is the integration of everything you've just given your attention to.

At the base of your spine: red. Grounded, stable, rooted.

In your lower belly: orange. Fluid, creative, alive.

At your solar plexus: yellow. Strong, confident, empowered.

At your heart: green. Open, compassionate, loving.

At your throat: blue. Clear, truthful, expressive.

Between your brows: indigo. Intuitive, insightful, wise.

At your crown: violet. Open, connected, transcendent.

...

...

Seven lights. Seven centres. One being. One continuum from earth to sky, from survival to transcendence, from body to spirit — all of it living in you right now.

...

...

Now imagine a line of light connecting all seven centres. A luminous column running from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. Like a pillar of energy, a strand of living light, linking every chakra in one continuous flow.

...

...

...

Breathe in, and imagine energy rising up through this column. From red, through orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, to violet. A wave of light ascending through you.

...

...

Breathe out, and imagine energy flowing back down. From violet, through indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, to red. A wave of light descending, returning to the earth.

...

...

Again. Breathing in, energy rises. The whole column illuminates from bottom to top.

...

...

Breathing out, energy descends. From crown to root. A gentle cascade.

...

...

...

Continue this breathing — rising on the inhale, descending on the exhale — for the next few breaths at your own pace. Feel the whole system activated. Feel the flow between the centres. Feel the column of light humming within you.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Now let the active visualisation soften. You don't need to hold it so precisely anymore. Let the colours blur and merge. Let the column of light become a general sense of inner radiance — a glow throughout your whole body. Not concentrated at any one point, but distributed everywhere.

...

...

...

...

Just rest in this feeling. The feeling of alignment. Of wholeness. Of all parts of your being — physical, emotional, mental, intuitive, spiritual — working together, integrated, balanced.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Take a few quiet breaths in this space. There's nothing to do. Just feel what it's like to be whole.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

When you're ready, gently begin to bring your awareness back to the room. Feel the chair or cushion beneath you. The sounds around you. The temperature of the air.

...

...

Take a deeper breath in.

...

And exhale fully.

...

Move your fingers and toes gently. Roll your shoulders in small circles. Turn your head slowly from side to side.

...

...

Open your eyes slowly. Let the light come in. Let the room reassemble around you.

...

...

You've just given careful, compassionate, sustained attention to the whole of your being — from root to crown, from earth to sky. Whether you understand the chakras as energy, as metaphor, or as a framework for attention, the result is the same: a deeper connection with your own body, a felt sense of balance, and a quiet knowing that you are, in this moment, whole.

Carry that with you.

...

Thanks for practising with Salus. Take care of yourself.
