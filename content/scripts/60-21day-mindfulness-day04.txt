What were you thinking sixty seconds ago?

...

Most people cannot answer that. Thoughts arrive, they do their work, and they leave without anyone noticing. A whole river of mental activity flowing past, and you standing in the middle of it, being carried along without ever looking down.

...

...

Today you are going to step out of the stream and stand on the bank. You are going to watch your own thinking as it happens, without getting involved with any of it.

...

This is one of the most useful skills in the entire course, and it has a name. It is called thought observation, and it comes from a branch of psychology called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.

...

...

The principle is straightforward. You are not your thoughts. Thoughts are events that happen in your mind, the same way sounds are events that happen in a room. You can hear a sound without becoming it. You can notice a thought without following it.

...

...

When you are ready, let your eyes close, and turn your attention inward.

...

...

Take a few breaths and let your body arrive here. There is no rush.

...

...

Now, instead of focusing on your breath or your body, turn your attention toward your thoughts themselves. Just watch. See what shows up.

...

...

A thought might arrive as words, as a sentence running through your head. Or it might arrive as an image, a memory, or just a vague pull toward something. All of these count.

...

Your only job is to notice each thought as it arrives, and then let it go. Do not follow it into a story. Do not argue with it. Do not try to stop it from coming. Just see it, acknowledge it, and watch it pass.

...

...

If it helps, you can give each thought a quiet label as it appears. Planning. Remembering. Worrying. Imagining. Judging. Just a single word, and then let it drift on.

...

...

Let us try this now. Sit with your thoughts for a minute or so in quiet.

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

What did you notice? Some people find that thoughts come thick and fast. Others find that when they actually look, the thoughts slow down or even disappear for a moment. Both are completely normal.

...

...

Here is the insight that makes this technique transformative. Most of the time, a thought appears and you immediately fuse with it. It says you are running late, and you are suddenly anxious. It says someone was unfair, and you are suddenly angry. There is no gap between the thought and the reaction.

...

But when you observe a thought instead of merging with it, something changes. You create distance. The thought is still there, but you are over here, watching it. And from that position, you get to choose whether to engage with it or let it pass.

...

...

Let us practise again. This time, pay particular attention to the sticky thoughts, the ones that pull you in. When one catches you, when you realise you have been following a thought for thirty seconds instead of watching it, that is not a failure. That is the moment of waking up. Notice it, and return to the bank of the stream.

...

...

I will leave you to practise this in quiet now. Stay on the bank. Watch the water.

[SILENCE: 90]

...

...

Gently bring your awareness back to the room around you. Notice the sounds, the temperature, the surface beneath you.

...

...

Open your eyes when you are ready, and take a moment before you move.

...

...

Your homework today takes one minute. At some point, stop and notice your next three thoughts as they arrive. Just three. Give each one a label. Planning. Remembering. Whatever it is. You do not have to do anything about them. Just see them clearly.

...

The stream keeps flowing whether you watch it or not. The difference is that now you can choose when to step in. See you tomorrow.
