This one works best lying down.

[SILENCE: 4]

If you can, stretch out on your back. Arms resting by your sides, palms facing upward. Legs uncrossed.

[SILENCE: 6]

Take a moment to adjust. Shift your weight until you are as comfortable as you can be right now.

[SILENCE: 8]

Let your weight drop into whatever surface is beneath you. The floor, the bed, the ground. Let it hold all of you.

[SILENCE: 8]

Take a breath. A full one, in through the nose and out through the mouth.

[SILENCE: 5]

And another. Even slower this time.

[SILENCE: 6]

And one more. Let it come in naturally and leave without any effort at all.

[SILENCE: 6]

Now let the breath return to its own rhythm. You do not need to manage it. Just let it happen.

[SILENCE: 12]

We are going to move through the body, region by region, from your toes to the top of your head.

There is nothing to fix here. Nothing to change. You are just visiting each part of yourself.

[SILENCE: 6]

Begin with the toes on your left foot. All five of them. Bring your full attention there and notice whatever you find.

[SILENCE: 18]

Warmth. Coolness. A faint tingling. Or maybe nothing at all. Whatever is there is the right answer.

[SILENCE: 12]

Now the sole of the left foot. The arch. The heel, pressing into the surface beneath you. Sense the weight of it.

[SILENCE: 15]

Move to the right foot now. The toes, the sole, the heel. The same patient attention.

[SILENCE: 15]

Notice whether one foot is warmer than the other. Whether one is clearer to you. There is no wrong observation here.

[SILENCE: 12]

Now let your attention travel upward into both ankles. The small bones on either side. The tendons running beneath the skin.

[SILENCE: 12]

Into the lower legs. The shins, the calves. Notice the weight of them. The way gravity pulls them downward and holds them there.

[SILENCE: 15]

Allow them to be completely heavy. You are not going anywhere. They have nothing to do right now.

[SILENCE: 12]

The knees. A joint that carries you through every day without once asking for your attention. Give them some now.

[SILENCE: 12]

And the thighs. The largest muscles in the body. Sense whatever has gathered there. Tension, warmth, tiredness, strength.

[SILENCE: 15]

You are now roughly halfway up the body. If your mind has wandered, that is completely normal.

Just guide your attention back, gently, to wherever we are.

[SILENCE: 8]

Now let your attention arrive at the hips and pelvis. The bowl of the body. Your centre of gravity.

[SILENCE: 10]

Notice the contact between your lower back and the surface beneath you. A gap, a curve, a warm pressure.

[SILENCE: 12]

The belly now. Rising and falling with each breath. Not controlling the movement. Just watching it happen, over and over.

[SILENCE: 25]

There is something remarkable about watching the breath move through the belly without interfering. It has been doing this your entire life.

[SILENCE: 15]

Now notice the sides of the body. The flanks, where the ribs curve around. An area that rarely receives any attention.

[SILENCE: 12]

Move into the chest. The ribcage widening and narrowing. The lungs doing their quiet, constant work without needing your permission.

[SILENCE: 15]

The upper back, between the shoulder blades. Two broad, flat anchors pressing into the floor or the mattress beneath you.

[SILENCE: 12]

Now bring your attention out to the hands. Begin with the fingertips. Each one distinct. Each one alive with tiny sensations.

[SILENCE: 15]

The palms of the hands. Open and upward. Notice the air against the skin. The temperature of it.

[SILENCE: 12]

The wrists. If you bring enough attention here, you can sometimes sense the faint rhythm of your own heartbeat.

[SILENCE: 12]

Move up through the forearms, past the elbows, into the upper arms. All the way to where the arms meet the shoulders.

[SILENCE: 12]

The shoulders. They carry more than most people realise. Notice what yours are holding right now.

[SILENCE: 8]

Then let them drop, just a fraction, toward the ground. You will be surprised how much they were still gripping.

[SILENCE: 12]

Notice how the body is all connected. The shoulder to the arm, the arm to the hand. Nothing exists in isolation here.

[SILENCE: 10]

The neck. Slender and strong. Holding the full weight of your head all day long. Allow it to release that weight now.

[SILENCE: 12]

The jaw. One of the most common places to hold tension without knowing it. Let the mouth fall open slightly. Teeth apart. Tongue heavy.

[SILENCE: 12]

The cheeks and the muscles around the eyes. Let everything behind the face go slack, like a mask you have decided to remove.

[SILENCE: 12]

The forehead. Smooth and wide. If there are lines of concentration there, let them dissolve. There is nothing to figure out right now.

[SILENCE: 12]

The scalp. The crown of your head. The very top. A place most people never think to visit. Rest your attention there now.

[SILENCE: 15]

And now, gently, let your awareness widen to include the whole body at once.

[SILENCE: 8]

Head to toes. One single, continuous, breathing shape, lying here on the ground.

[SILENCE: 20]

You are not thinking about the body now. You are resting inside it. You are it.

[SILENCE: 20]

Stay here for a while. No instructions. No narration. Just you, breathing.

[SILENCE: 120]

Gently now, begin to bring some movement back. A small wiggle in the fingers. A slow roll of the ankles.

......

Take a longer breath. Let it fill you from the belly all the way to the collarbones.

......

And when you are ready, let your eyes open. There is no rush at all.

......

You have just given every part of your body a few minutes of attention. That is a generous and uncommon thing to do.

[SILENCE: 5]

Come back to this whenever you need to arrive somewhere familiar.
