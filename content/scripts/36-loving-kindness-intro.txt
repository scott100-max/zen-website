Find a comfortable position, wherever you are right now. Sitting is great, but lying down works too.

...

Let your hands rest somewhere that feels easy and natural.

...

Close your eyes, or soften your gaze downward.

...

Take a slow breath in through your nose, letting your chest and belly expand gently.

...

And let it all go. Just a long, easy exhale.

...

One more time. Breathe in slowly.

...

And gently release it all.

...

Good. Now today we're going to practise something called loving-kindness meditation. In the traditional language, it's known as metta. And the idea is beautifully simple. We are going to practise generating feelings of warmth and goodwill, first toward yourself, and then gradually outward toward others.

...

Think of it like a workout for the part of you that cares. You're not forcing anything. You're not trying to manufacture some big wave of emotion. You are simply setting an intention, quietly, in your own mind, and letting it land however it lands.

...

If it feels a bit awkward at first, that's completely normal. Most people find that the hardest part is actually directing kindness toward themselves. So if that comes up for you, just notice it. There's nothing wrong with you. It's just unfamiliar.

...

Let's begin. Bring your attention to the centre of your chest. You might even place a hand there if that feels right. Just notice whatever you find. Maybe warmth. Maybe tightness. Maybe nothing at all. All of it is fine.

...

Now, silently, in your own mind, offer yourself these simple phrases. I'll say them, and you repeat them inwardly, as a quiet wish for yourself.

...

May I be safe. May I be happy.

...

May I be healthy. May I live with ease.

...

Let's go through them once more, a little slower this time. And see if you can actually mean them. Not as a performance, just as a gentle wish you're making for yourself, the way you might wish something kind for a friend.

...

Silently now, may I be safe.

...

May I be happy. Truly happy.

...

May I be healthy and strong.

...

May I live with ease.

...

...

Whatever you felt just then, warmth, nothing, awkwardness, resistance, it's all perfectly fine. The intention is what matters here. The feeling often comes later, sometimes days later, in ways you don't expect. This practice is like planting seeds. You don't dig them up to check if they're growing. You just keep planting.

...

I'll be silent for a moment now. Just stay with this warmth, this quiet intention of kindness toward yourself. If the phrases want to continue on their own, let them. If your mind wanders, that's okay too. Just gently come back.

[SILENCE: 60 seconds]

...

Good. Now let's shift. Bring to mind someone you love. Someone whose face makes you smile just thinking about them. A partner, a friend, a family member, a child, a pet. Whoever comes to mind first is exactly right.

...

Picture them clearly. See their face. Remember what it feels like to be near them. And now, direct those same wishes toward them.

...

May you be safe. May you be happy.

...

May you be healthy. May you live with ease.

...

Notice how this feels. For most people, this is the easier part, sending kindness to someone you already love. You're just making conscious what's already there, putting words to something your heart already knows.

...

Gently now, may you be safe.

...

May you be happy. Deeply happy.

...

May you be healthy and whole.

...

May you live with ease.

[SILENCE: 30 seconds]

Good. Now let's go wider. Imagine this feeling of warmth radiating outward from you, like ripples spreading across still water. Beyond the people you know, beyond your neighbourhood, your city, outward in every direction.

...

Picture all the people going about their lives right now. People working. People resting. People laughing. People struggling. Every one of them carrying their own hopes, their own fears, just like you. And offer them these same wishes.

...

May all beings be safe. May all beings be happy.

...

May all beings be healthy. May all beings live with ease.

...

...

Let that settle. You don't need to feel some cosmic wave of love. Just the willingness to wish well, that quiet intention, that's enough. That's the whole practice.

...

Now, gently let go of the phrases. Let go of any images. Come back to just sitting here, breathing.

...

Take a slow breath in.

...

And gently let it go.

...

Notice how you feel. There might be a softness in your chest. A quiet warmth. Or there might be nothing obvious, and that's perfectly okay. Research shows that even a few minutes of this practice can shift your mood and increase feelings of connection. And the more you do it, the more natural it becomes, not just during meditation, but in how you move through your day.

...

When you're ready, gently open your eyes. Take a moment before you move on to whatever comes next. And carry a little of this warmth with you.
