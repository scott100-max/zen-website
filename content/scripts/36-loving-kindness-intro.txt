Welcome to Salus.

Today we're going to try something a little different. It's called loving-kindness meditation — or metta, if you want the traditional name. And before you roll your eyes at the name, hear me out. This is one of the most researched and effective meditation practices out there. It's simple, it's powerful, and it might surprise you.

The basic idea is this: we're going to practise generating feelings of warmth and goodwill. First toward yourself, then toward others. That's it. It's like a workout for the part of you that cares.

...

So let's get settled. Find a comfortable position. Sitting is great, but if you're lying down, that works too. Let your hands rest wherever feels natural.

...

Close your eyes, or soften your gaze downward.

...

Take a couple of easy breaths to arrive. In through the nose.

...

And out.

...

One more. In.

...

And let it go.

...

Good. Now, we're going to start with you. And I know — for a lot of people, this is actually the hardest part. It can feel awkward or even uncomfortable to direct kindness toward yourself. If that comes up, that's okay. You don't have to force anything. Just be willing to try.

...

Bring to mind an image of yourself. You might picture yourself as you are right now, sitting here. Or you might think of yourself as a child. Whatever comes naturally.

...

And silently, in your mind, offer yourself these phrases. I'll say them, and you repeat them inwardly:

May I be happy.

...

May I be healthy.

...

May I be safe.

...

May I live with ease.

...

Let's go through them once more, slowly. And this time, try to actually mean them. Not as a performance — just as a quiet wish for yourself.

May I be happy.

...

May I be healthy.

...

May I be safe.

...

May I live with ease.

...

...

Good. Whatever you felt — warmth, nothing, awkwardness — it's all fine. The intention matters more than the feeling. The feeling often comes later.

...

Now, let's shift. Bring to mind someone you love. Someone who makes you smile just thinking about them. A partner, a friend, a family member, a pet — whoever comes to mind first.

Picture them clearly. See their face. Remember what it feels like to be around them.

...

And now, direct those same wishes toward them:

May you be happy.

...

May you be healthy.

...

May you be safe.

...

May you live with ease.

...

Notice how this feels. For most people, this is the easiest part — sending kindness to someone you already love. You're just making conscious what's already there.

...

May you be happy.

...

May you be healthy.

...

May you be safe.

...

May you live with ease.

...

...

Good. Now, here's where it gets interesting. I'd like you to bring to mind a neutral person. Someone you neither like nor dislike. Maybe it's the barista who made your coffee this morning. A neighbour you see but don't really know. Someone on the bus.

Just a regular human being, going about their life.

...

This person has hopes and fears, just like you. They have good days and bad days. They want to be happy, just like you do.

...

Send them the same wishes:

May you be happy.

...

May you be healthy.

...

May you be safe.

...

May you live with ease.

...

...

This is the practice. This is where it starts to stretch your capacity — extending care beyond your inner circle to the wider world of people you don't even know.

...

Now, let's go wider still. Imagine these wishes radiating outward from you like ripples in water. Out past the people you know, out past your neighbourhood, your city.

...

Picture all the people going about their days right now. People working, people sleeping, people laughing, people struggling.

...

And offer this:

May all beings be happy.

...

May all beings be healthy.

...

May all beings be safe.

...

May all beings live with ease.

...

...

...

Let that settle. You don't need to feel some cosmic wave of love. Just the willingness to wish well — that's enough.

...

...

Now, gently let go of the phrases. Let go of any images. Come back to just sitting here, breathing.

...

Take a breath in.

...

And let it out.

...

Notice how you feel. There might be a softness in your chest. There might be a quiet warmth. Or there might be nothing obvious — and that's perfectly okay. This practice is like planting seeds. You don't always see the results right away, but they grow.

...

Research shows that even a few minutes of loving-kindness practice can shift your mood, reduce stress, and increase feelings of connection. And the more you do it, the more natural it becomes — not just during meditation, but in how you move through your day.

...

When you're ready, gently open your eyes. Carry a little of this warmth with you into whatever comes next.

...

Thanks for practising with Salus. Be kind to yourself today.
