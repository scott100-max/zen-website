  <h2>Intro (0:00–0:30)</h2>
  <p class="direction">[Gentle chime sounds. Ambient music fades in.]</p>
  <p>Welcome to Zenscape. This is your ten-minute morning meditation — a gentle way to start your day with clarity and intention.</p>
  <p>Find a comfortable position. You can sit upright or lie down — whatever feels right for you this morning. Let your hands rest naturally. Close your eyes when you're ready.</p>

  <h2>Body Scan & Arrival (0:30–2:30)</h2>
  <p>Take a deep breath in through your nose... and slowly out through your mouth.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 5 seconds</span>
  <p>Again. Breathe in, filling your lungs completely... and release, letting go of anything you carried from sleep.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 5 seconds</span>
  <p>Begin to notice your body. Feel the weight of your head... your shoulders. Let them soften. Feel the support beneath you — the chair, the floor, the bed. You're held. You're safe.</p>
  <p>Scan down through your arms... your hands. Notice any tension and let it dissolve with your next exhale.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 5 seconds</span>
  <p>Move your awareness down through your torso... your hips... your legs... all the way to your feet. Just noticing. No need to change anything.</p>

  <h2>Breath Awareness (2:30–5:00)</h2>
  <p>Now bring your attention to your breath. Don't try to control it — just observe. Notice the cool air entering your nostrils... the gentle rise of your chest... the warm air leaving your body.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 10 seconds</span>
  <p>Each breath is a small beginning. Each inhale is an invitation. Each exhale is a release.</p>
  <p>If your mind wanders — and it will — that's perfectly natural. Simply notice where it went, and gently guide your attention back to the breath. No judgment. Just returning.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 30 seconds (breathing space)</span>
  <p>You're doing beautifully. Stay with the breath.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 30 seconds</span>

  <h2>Setting Intention (5:00–7:00)</h2>
  <p>Now, keeping your eyes closed, I'd like you to think about the day ahead. Not the tasks or the schedule — just the feeling you want to carry with you.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 5 seconds</span>
  <p>Maybe it's calm. Maybe it's focus. Maybe it's kindness — toward yourself and others. Choose one word. One intention. Let it settle in your mind like a stone in still water.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 10 seconds</span>
  <p>Hold that word gently. Don't grip it — just let it be there. This is your anchor for the day. When things feel rushed or uncertain, you can return to this word. It's always there for you.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 15 seconds</span>

  <h2>Gratitude (7:00–8:30)</h2>
  <p>Before we begin to close, take a moment to feel grateful. Not for anything specific — though you can if you'd like — but simply for this moment. For the fact that you chose to be here, to begin your day with stillness.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 10 seconds</span>
  <p>Gratitude has a way of softening us. It opens a small door that lets light in. Even on difficult days, this moment is yours.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 10 seconds</span>

  <h2>Closing (8:30–10:00)</h2>
  <p>Now, gently begin to bring your awareness back to the room. Feel the surface beneath you. Notice any sounds around you — the hum of the morning.</p>
  <p>Wiggle your fingers and toes. Take one more deep breath in... and a long, slow exhale.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 5 seconds</span>
  <p>When you're ready, open your eyes. Take in the light. You've given yourself a gift this morning — ten minutes of stillness that will carry through the hours ahead.</p>
  <p>Thank you for practising with Zenscape. Sleep. Relax. Restore.</p>
