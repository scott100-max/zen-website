Welcome to The Tabletop.
...
This is a core beliefs exercise. It works a little differently from other sessions you may have tried.
...
Most CBT exercises deal with surface thoughts. The automatic ones. I am going to fail this. They do not like me. Something will go wrong. Those thoughts are real, and they cause real distress. But they are not the whole story.
...
Underneath those thoughts, deeper down, there are beliefs. Beliefs about who you are, what you deserve, and how the world works. They have been there so long that they do not feel like beliefs any more. They feel like facts.
......
Today we are going to find one of those beliefs. And we are going to look at what is actually holding it up.
...
......
Sit comfortably. Let your hands rest.
...
Take a slow breath in through your nose.
[SILENCE: 4]
And release it through your mouth. No performance. Just settling.
...
One more. In through the nose.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out. Good. Let your breathing find its own rhythm.
......
I want you to imagine a table. A simple one. Wooden. Four legs. Nothing on it yet.
...
In a moment, I am going to ask you to place something on that table. Not an object. A sentence. A belief you carry about yourself. One of the deep ones.
...
It usually starts with two words. I am. And then something that tightens your chest a little when you say it. I am not enough. I am a burden. I am always behind. I am going to be found out.
...
You probably already know which one is yours. It has been with you a long time. Take a moment to let it surface.
...
[SILENCE: 20]
Place that sentence on the table. Read it. Sit with it for a moment.
...
Notice how your body responds to it. Notice how familiar it feels. This is not a new thought. This is something you have been carrying for years, maybe decades. It has the weight of certainty.
......
But certainty is not the same as truth. A belief only feels certain because it has legs to stand on. And that is what we are going to examine now. Not the belief itself. The legs.
......
The legs of a belief are references. Experiences, memories, things people said to you, things you interpreted in a certain way. Each one props the belief up a little more, until it feels unshakeable.
...
Let us look at the first leg. Think of the earliest memory you have that seems to support this belief. It might be from childhood. A teacher, a parent, a moment on a playground. Something that made you think, this must be true about me.
...
[SILENCE: 20]
Hold that memory. Look at it clearly. How old were you? What actually happened? Not the story you have told yourself since. The raw event.
...
Now ask yourself this. If a child you loved came to you and described that same event, would you draw the same conclusion they did? Would you look at a seven-year-old, or a twelve-year-old, and say yes, that proves it, you are not enough?
...
Or would you see a child making the only sense they could of something that was never theirs to carry?
......
That is the first leg. It may not be as solid as you thought.
......
Now a second leg. Think of a more recent experience that seems to confirm this belief. Something from the last few years. A relationship, a job, a moment where the old sentence came back and said, see, I told you.
...
[SILENCE: 20]
Look at that experience clearly. Is there only one way to read it? Or did your belief arrive first and then look for evidence to support itself?
...
This is what beliefs do. They act as filters. Once you believe something, your brain highlights everything that confirms it and quietly discards everything that contradicts it. Not because the contradictions do not exist. Because the belief does not want them to.
......
That is the second leg. It may be interpretation dressed as proof.
......
Now a third leg. This one is often the hardest to see. It is what other people told you. Parents, teachers, partners, friends. Sentences that landed and stayed.
...
You are too sensitive. You will never be like your sister. Why can you not just be normal? You are not the kind of person who succeeds at that.
...
Those sentences were never evidence. They were opinions, delivered by people who had their own pain, their own limitations, their own unexamined beliefs.
...
But when someone says something with enough conviction, especially when you are young, it becomes a leg. A strong one.
......
Look at your table now. Three legs. One from childhood, one from recent experience, one from other people's words.
...
Are any of those legs truly solid? Or are they assumptions, misreadings, and someone else's baggage?
......
Here is what I want you to understand. The belief on your table feels like concrete. But it is not. It is a wooden tabletop balanced on legs that may not bear scrutiny. Some of those legs were installed when you were a child. Some were handed to you by people who could barely hold up their own tables.
...
You have been treating this belief as a permanent feature of who you are. But it is furniture. And furniture can be examined, repaired, or removed.
......
You do not have to dismantle the whole table today. That is not the point of this exercise. The point is to see, clearly and without flinching, that your deepest beliefs about yourself are held up by evidence that deserves questioning.
...
The moment you question it, the certainty loosens. Not all at once. But enough to create a crack. And a crack is all you need. A crack means light gets in.
......
Breathe in slowly. Wide and unhurried.
[SILENCE: 4]
And let it go.
...
Let the table dissolve. The legs. The surface. The sentence written on it. Let it all fade for now.
...
Bring your awareness back to the room around you. The weight of your body. The air on your skin. The sounds nearby.
...
Open your eyes whenever you are ready.
...
The next time that old belief arrives, and it will, do not argue with it. Just ask one question. What is holding this up?
...
You might be surprised how little is there.
...
Thank you for practising with Salus.
