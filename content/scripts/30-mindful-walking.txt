Today we're doing something a little different. We're going to meditate while moving. This is a walking meditation, and it's one of the most practical mindfulness practices out there because, well, you walk every day. You might as well be present for it.

You can do this indoors or outdoors. You don't need a lot of space — even ten feet of floor is enough. You'll walk slowly back and forth, or if you're outside, along a path. Keep your eyes open for this one, obviously. Soft gaze, looking a few feet ahead of you. Not staring at anything in particular.

Stand up and take a moment to just feel yourself standing.

...

Feel your feet on the ground. The pressure of the floor or earth beneath you. The subtle adjustments your body makes to keep you balanced. We take standing for granted, but it's actually a remarkable act of coordination.

...

Let your arms hang naturally at your sides, or clasp your hands gently in front of you or behind you. Whatever feels comfortable and won't distract you.

...

Now, very slowly, begin to walk. Much slower than normal. We're not going anywhere. There's no destination. The walk itself is the point.

Start with your left foot. Lift it.

...

Notice the sensation of lifting. The muscles in your leg engaging. The weight shifting to your right foot.

...

Move the left foot forward. Feel it travel through the air.

...

Place it down. Heel first, then the ball of the foot, then the toes. Feel the ground meet your foot.

...

Now the right foot. Lift.

...

Move.

...

Place.

...

That's the rhythm. Lift. Move. Place. Lift. Move. Place. Stay with each step fully.

...

...

...

...

Continue at this pace. If it feels unnaturally slow, that's okay. We slow down to notice what we normally miss. You've taken thousands of steps today without feeling a single one. Right now, feel them.

...

...

...

...

Notice the weight transfer from one foot to the other. That moment when you're balanced on one leg. The contact of sole against surface.

...

...

...

...

If you're walking back and forth, when you reach the end of your path, stop. Stand still for a breath. Turn slowly. And begin again.

...

...

...

...

Now begin to expand your awareness. Keep feeling your feet, but also notice your body as it moves. The sway of your arms. The gentle rotation of your hips. The way your whole body participates in this simple act of walking.

...

...

...

...

And expand further. If you're outside, notice your surroundings. The air on your face. The sounds around you. Colours and shapes in your peripheral vision. You can take all of this in while still anchoring your attention on the feet. Walking and being aware of the world at the same time.

If you're indoors, notice the room. The light. The quality of the space.

...

...

...

...

...

...

When your mind wanders — when you start planning dinner or replaying a conversation — just notice it. And come back to the feet. Back to lift, move, place.

...

...

...

...

You can gradually let your pace become a little more natural now. Not your usual hurried stride, but something closer to a normal walk. See if you can maintain the same quality of attention at this more natural speed.

...

...

...

...

This is what you can take with you. Any time you're walking — to the office, to the shops, from the car to the front door — you can turn it into a moment of practice. Feel your feet. Notice your body moving. Be here for the walk instead of just getting through it.

...

...

...

...

Go ahead and come to a stop now. Stand still.

...

Feel your feet on the ground. Feel your whole body standing.

...

Take a breath.

...

...

That's walking meditation. It's available to you any time you're on your feet. And it's a great reminder that mindfulness isn't about sitting still with your eyes closed — it's about being present for your life as you're living it, one step at a time.

Thanks for walking with me. I'll see you next time on Salus.
