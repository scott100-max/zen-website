Right now, wherever you are, you are safe enough to take three minutes. That is all we need.
...
Take a breath. A real one. In through your nose, letting your lungs open wide.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out through your mouth. Let your shoulders drop as the air leaves.
...
We are going to ground you in the present moment using your senses. Look around and name five things you can see. Anything at all. Let your eyes drift to five separate things.
...
...
Good. Now four things you can touch right now. The surface under your hands, the fabric on your skin. Two more, wherever your attention lands.
...
...
Three things you can hear. Listen for the small sounds, the ones hiding underneath everything else.
...
Two things you can smell. If nothing comes to mind, just notice the air itself.
...
And one thing you can taste. Even if it is just the inside of your mouth. That counts.
...
You are here now. Not in the last hour, not in the next. Right here, with your lungs working and your body steady.
...
Take one last breath. Wide and slow, in through your nose.
[SILENCE: 4]
And let it go. You have given yourself three minutes, and that is enough.
...
Thank you for practising with Salus. Go gently out there.
