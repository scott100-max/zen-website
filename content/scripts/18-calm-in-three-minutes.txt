Whatever's happening right now, you made a good call pressing play.

...

That already took something. So let's work with that.

...

You don't need to close your eyes if that doesn't feel right. Just let your gaze soften.

...

Look at something still. A wall. A corner. The floor. Anything that isn't moving.

...

Now we're going to breathe together. A simple box breath. In for four, hold for four, out for four, hold for four. That's it. Stay with me.

Breathe in... two... three... four.

...

Hold... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four.

...

Hold... two... three... four.

...

Good. Again.

In... two... three... four.

...

Hold... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four.

...

Hold... two... three... four.

...

One more round. Stay with me here.

In... two... three... four.

...

Hold... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four.

...

Hold... two... three... four.

...

OK. You're doing well. Let your breathing return to whatever feels natural for a moment.

[PAUSE: 30 seconds]

Now let's land you back in the room. We're going to use your senses. Just notice — don't judge, don't analyse. Just notice.

Name five things you can see. Anything at all. Just let your eyes drift to five things.

...

...

Good. Four things you can touch. Feel the texture of your clothes. The surface under your hands. The temperature of the air on your skin. One more.

...

Three things you can hear. Even small things. Even silence has a texture to it.

...

Two things you can smell. If you can't pick anything up, that's fine — just notice the air.

...

And one thing you can taste. Even if it's just the inside of your mouth. That counts.

...

OK. You're here. You're present. Your feet are on the ground. Your lungs are working. Your heart rate has already started to come down — you might notice that.

...

Take one more breath. A deep one. In through the nose.

...

And let it go. Slowly. All the way out.

...

Whatever was pulling at you — it's still there, and that's OK. But you've got a little more space around it now. A little more room to move.

You handled that well. Whenever you need this, it's here.
