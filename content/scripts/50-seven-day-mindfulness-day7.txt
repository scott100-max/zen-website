Welcome back to Salus.

Day Seven. The final day. You made it.

Seven days ago you started something. You probably didn't know exactly what would happen. Maybe you were sceptical. Maybe hopeful. Maybe both.

And now here you are. You've completed an entire week of mindfulness practice. That's real. That matters.

...

Today we're going to bring everything together — breath, body, thoughts, emotions, and open awareness. A complete practice. And then we'll talk about where to go from here.

...

Find your position. Sitting is ideal. A posture that's both alert and relaxed.

...

Close your eyes.

...

Take three deep, conscious breaths. Arriving fully. Breathing in.

...

Breathing out.

...

In.

...

Out.

...

In.

...

And release.

...

Let your breath return to natural.

...

...

Let's begin with the body. Day Two's practice. Briefly scan through your body from head to toe. Just a quick sweep of awareness.

Notice the top of your head.

...

Your face, your jaw.

...

Your neck and shoulders.

...

Your arms and hands.

...

Your chest and belly.

...

Your back.

...

Your hips and legs.

...

Your feet.

...

Your whole body, sitting here, breathing.

...

...

Now, bring your attention to the breath. Day One's anchor. Find where you feel it most clearly — nostrils, chest, or belly. Rest your attention there.

...

Follow each breath. In.

...

Out.

...

In.

...

Out.

...

...

...

When your mind wanders, notice that. Day Three. See the thought, recognise "thinking," and gently return to the breath.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Notice any emotions present. Day Four. You don't need to do anything about them. Just acknowledge what's here. Happy, tired, peaceful, restless — whatever it is.

...

...

...

If there's a strong emotion, feel where it lives in your body. Hold it with kindness.

...

...

...

Now, expand your awareness. Day Five and Six. Include sounds, sensations, thoughts, breath — all of it at once. Open awareness. Not focusing on any one thing. Just being present with everything.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Rest in this open awareness. The mind naturally settles when we stop grasping. You don't have to do anything. Just be.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Notice — right now, in this moment, nothing is wrong. Whatever problems exist in your life, in this exact moment, here, you're okay. You're breathing. You're aware. You're alive.

This is what mindfulness reveals: most of our suffering is in our thoughts about the past or future. The present moment, simply experienced, is usually fine.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Take a slightly deeper breath.

...

And exhale.

...

Begin to come back. Feel your body in the chair. Feel your feet on the floor.

...

Gently open your eyes.

...

...

You've now completed the seven-day course. Let me share some thoughts about going forward.

...

First: you now have real experience with mindfulness. Not just ideas — experience. You know what it feels like to watch your thoughts instead of being lost in them. You know how to find emotions in your body. You know how to anchor in the breath. These are skills you can use for the rest of your life.

...

Second: the hard part isn't learning mindfulness. It's remembering to practise. Life gets busy, and mindfulness is easy to forget. So here's my suggestion: commit to a specific time each day. Morning is good for many people — before the day sweeps you away. Even just five minutes. Put it in your calendar like any other appointment.

...

Third: bring mindfulness into your daily life. This is where it really matters. A moment of presence while eating. A few conscious breaths before a meeting. Feeling your feet while walking. These small moments add up.

...

Fourth: be patient with yourself. Some days you'll sit down to meditate and your mind will be wild. That's normal. It doesn't mean you're failing. It means you're practising on a hard day, which is actually more valuable than practising on an easy day.

...

Finally: if you want to go deeper, Salus has many more sessions to explore. Body scans, loving-kindness, advanced practices. There's a lifetime of depth here. The seven-day course is just the beginning.

...

Thank you for this week. Thank you for showing up, day after day. You've given yourself a genuine gift.

I hope you'll continue. But even if you don't, what you've learned this week is yours forever. The present moment is always available. Your breath is always there. Awareness is always here.

...

Day Seven — complete. Course complete.

Congratulations.

Thanks for practising with Salus.
