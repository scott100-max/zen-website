Welcome to Salus.

Today's practice is mindful eating. And for this one, you'll need some food. It can be anything — a meal, a snack, even a single raisin or a piece of chocolate. Whatever you have. The point isn't what you eat. It's how you eat it.

Most of us eat on autopilot. We eat while scrolling, while watching, while working, while driving. We shovel food in without really tasting it, and then wonder where it went. Mindful eating is the antidote to that. It's about slowing down and actually experiencing the food in front of you.

So, have your food ready. If you haven't started eating yet, hold off. We'll begin together.

...

First, just look at your food. Really look at it. Notice the colours. The shapes. The textures. The way light hits it. If it's a simple piece of fruit, look at the variations in colour. If it's a full meal, take in the whole plate. We almost never actually see our food. We glance at it and start eating.

...

...

Notice if there's a visual appeal. Does it look appetising? What makes it look that way?

...

Now, bring the food closer and notice the smell. Breathe it in. What do you detect? Is it one aroma or several? Is it subtle or strong? Notice if your mouth starts to water. That's your body responding to the anticipation of eating. Your digestive system is already getting ready.

...

...

If you're holding the food, notice how it feels in your hand. The weight. The temperature. The texture against your fingers. Smooth, rough, sticky, firm, soft. We have this incredible sense of touch and we rarely use it with food.

...

...

Now, take your first bite. But before you chew, just let it sit in your mouth for a moment. Feel the texture on your tongue. Notice the initial burst of flavour. Is it sweet, salty, sour, bitter, savoury? Is it one clear note or a combination?

...

...

Begin to chew. Slowly. Much more slowly than usual. Feel the texture change as you chew. Notice how the flavour evolves — food often tastes different after a few chews than it did on first bite. The enzymes in your saliva are already starting to break the food down, releasing new flavours.

...

...

...

Before you swallow, notice the impulse to swallow. It's usually automatic. Today, make it a choice. Swallow when you're ready, and feel the food move down your throat.

...

...

Take a breath between bites. Put your fork down if you're using one. This pause is important. It gives your body time to register what it's receiving. It gives your mind time to appreciate it.

...

...

Take another bite. Same approach. Look at it before it reaches your mouth. Notice the smell. Feel the texture. Taste it fully. Chew slowly.

...

...

...

...

Notice the experience of hunger and satisfaction. As you eat, can you feel the transition? The body has subtle signals — a softening of the urgency, a quieting of the hunger. We often miss these because we eat too fast.

...

...

...

...

Continue eating at this pace. I'll be quiet for a minute and let you practise on your own. Slow, attentive, appreciative. One bite at a time.

...

As you eat, consider what it took for this food to reach you. The soil it grew in. The sun and rain. Someone planted it, tended it, harvested it. Others transported it, stocked it, maybe cooked it. There's a whole chain of effort and care behind every bite. That's worth a moment of appreciation.

...

...

...

Take a few more bites on your own. Stay with the experience. If your mind wanders to your phone, to what you need to do next, to the news — just come back to the food. Back to the taste, the texture, the moment.

...

...

...

...

...

...

When you feel ready, or when you've finished your food, pause.

...

Notice how your body feels now compared to when you started. Do you feel nourished? Satisfied? Still hungry? Full?

...

Take a breath.

...

That's mindful eating. You don't have to do this with every meal — though you certainly can. Even one mindful bite at the start of a meal can shift the whole experience. It's a way of being present for one of the most basic, essential, pleasurable parts of being human.

Thanks for eating with me. I'll see you next time on Salus. Enjoy the rest of your meal.
