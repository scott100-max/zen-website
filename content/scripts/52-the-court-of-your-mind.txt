Expected-Repetitions: Where is your evidence
---
Your mind has been busy building a case against you.
...
It happens to all of us. A thought arrives, uninvited. You are not good enough. You are going to fail. They will find out you do not belong. And before you can question it, the thought has taken the chair. It has become the prosecution. And you, without realising it, have accepted the verdict before the trial has even begun.
...
This is something most of us carry and never examine. We let the inner critic speak unopposed. It makes claims, we accept them. It predicts disaster, we brace for it. It tells us who we are, and we believe it. Not because the evidence supports it. But because the voice is so certain.
...
Today we are going to do something different. We are going to hold that trial. A proper one. With evidence. Cross-examination. And a verdict based on facts, not on fear. You might be surprised by how it ends.
...
......
Sit somewhere comfortable. Let your hands rest wherever they fall naturally.
...
Breathe in through your nose now, one wide and unhurried breath.
[SILENCE: 4]
And let it go through your mouth. Not dramatic. Just releasing what you do not need.
...
One more now. In through your nose, a little wider this time.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out. Good. Let your breathing return to whatever rhythm it wants.
...
......
Now I want you to picture a courtroom. Take a moment to build it in your mind. Not a dramatic one from a film, with cameras and crowds. Something quieter. More formal. Oak panels along the walls. A high ceiling. Soft, even light from tall windows.
...
A gallery behind you, mostly empty. A few rows of wooden benches. The air is cool and still. At the front, a judge's bench, raised above everything else. Below it, two tables face each other. And between them, a single chair.
...
You are sitting in that chair. Not as someone who has done something wrong. As someone whose case is being heard. You are here to listen.
...
......
At the table on your left sits the prosecution. You know this voice well. It is the one that has been speaking inside you for as long as you can remember. The one that wakes you at three in the morning with a list of everything that could go wrong tomorrow.
...
The one that tightens your chest before a meeting, before a phone call, before anything that carries the smallest possibility of judgment.
...
This voice does not whisper. It states. It announces. It has the confidence of someone who has never once been questioned. It says things like: you are not ready. You are going to embarrass yourself. Everyone else handles this without effort. What is wrong with you?
...
And because the voice is so certain, you have always assumed it must be right.
...
......
At the table on your right sits the defence. You might not know this voice as well. It is quieter. Measured. It does not shout over the prosecution. It has no need to. Because it has something the prosecution has never had. Evidence.
...
......
The judge looks to the prosecution and nods. Make your case.
...
The prosecution stands. Confident. Practised. It addresses the court without notes. It does not need them. It has delivered this speech a thousand times.
...
This person is not capable. They lack the ability to handle what lies ahead. They have always been this way. The outcome is inevitable. They will fail, and everyone around them will see it.
...
The prosecution pauses, then continues. And it is not only the future. Think about the past. Think about the mistakes this person has made. The moments they stumbled. The times they were not enough. This is not an isolated incident. This is a pattern. This is who they are.
...
Strong words. Certain words. The kind that land in your chest and make your stomach tighten. You have heard this speech before. Many, many times. And every time, you have believed it.
...
......
The judge turns to the table on the right. Your response?
...
The defence does not stand immediately. There is no rush. After a moment, it rises. And it does not address the judge. It turns directly to the prosecution. And asks one question.
...
Can you provide specific evidence for any of those claims?
...
......
The courtroom goes quiet. Not the dramatic silence of a film. A real silence. The kind that fills a room when someone has been asked a question they cannot answer.
...
The prosecution clears its throat. Shuffles some papers. It looks as though it is about to present something important. It opens its mouth. But nothing comes.
...
Because the prosecution has never needed evidence before. It has always been enough to just say the words with conviction. Nobody ever asked for proof. Not once.
...
......
The defence speaks again. Without hostility. Without aggression. Just precision. You claim this person is not capable. When exactly did they prove incapable? Can you name the date? The situation? Can you point to a single instance where the predicted disaster actually occurred?
...
......
Think about that now. Genuinely. Not as an exercise. As a real question aimed at the part of your mind that has been making these claims for years.
...
When did the thing you feared most actually come true? When did you walk into that room, that meeting, that conversation, and the catastrophe you imagined actually happened? Not the worry beforehand. Not the dread on the way there. The actual event. The real outcome.
...
Search your memory now. Give yourself all the time you need.
...
[SILENCE: 20]
What most people discover, when they sit with that question honestly, is something remarkable. The prosecution has been running this case for years. Sometimes decades. And it has almost no evidence. The fears were loud. They were vivid. They were convincing. But they were not accurate.
...
......
Maybe there was a time. Perhaps one. Maybe a few. Moments that did not go the way you hoped. The prosecution has clung to those. It has polished them, made them bigger than they were. And from those few moments, it has built an entire case. An entire identity. That is not evidence. That is a story constructed on the thinnest of foundations.
...
......
The defence turns to the judge. Your Honour, I would like to present the actual record. Not predictions. Not fears. Not stories. What actually happened.
...
......
This person has shown up. Repeatedly. They have walked into rooms they were afraid to enter. They have spoken when their voice shook. They have started things they were not sure they could finish, and they finished them.
...
I am going to ask you to do something now. I want you to recall a specific time when you were afraid but you did it anyway. A conversation you did not want to have. A challenge you were not sure you were ready for. Something that asked more of you than you thought you could give. And you gave it.
...
Let that specific memory surface now. Take your time. There is no rush.
...
[SILENCE: 30]
Hold that memory. That is evidence. That is exhibit one for the defence.
...
......
Now think of a time when you were certain you would not cope. When the prosecution was at its loudest. When every part of you said: this is the one. This is where it all goes wrong. And then it did not go wrong. You handled it. Maybe not the way you planned. But you handled it.
...
[SILENCE: 30]
That is exhibit two. A direct contradiction of the prosecution's entire argument.
...
......
And one more. Think about the last time you were genuinely proud of yourself, even quietly. A moment where you did something difficult and came through it. It does not have to be dramatic. It might be a small thing. A boundary you held. A decision you made when the easier option was to do nothing. A day you got through when getting through was the hardest thing you had done in weeks.
...
[SILENCE: 30]
Exhibit three. Another fact the prosecution chose to ignore.
...
......
The defence looks at the judge. Three pieces of evidence. Exposed under genuine recall. Not stories, not affirmations, not things someone told this person to make them feel better. Real memories. Real outcomes.
...
The prosecution offered predictions. The defence has offered facts. And the facts tell a very different story.
...
......
The prosecution describes a person who cannot cope. The evidence describes someone who has coped with everything their life has asked of them. Not always gracefully. Not always with confidence. But they have coped. Every time. Without exception.
...
......
Let that land. Not as a motivational speech. As a factual summary of your own life. Every difficult situation you have faced, you have come through. You may not have enjoyed it. You may not have handled it the way you wished you had. But you came through it. Here you are. That is the only evidence that matters.
...
......
[SILENCE: 15]
The judge looks at the prosecution. Do you have anything further?
...
The prosecution does not. It never does, once someone asks for evidence. Its entire power depends on no one asking. The moment you ask, the case collapses. It always does.
...
......
The judge closes the folder. Straightens the papers. Looks once more at the prosecution. Then speaks two words. Case dismissed.
...
......
[SILENCE: 10]
The courtroom begins to empty. The prosecution gathers its papers and leaves. The papers were blank. They were always blank.
...
......
Here is what I want you to take from this room. A tool you can use any time the prosecution reconvenes. And it will reconvene. That voice does not retire. It comes back before the next meeting, the next challenge, the next moment that matters. That is what it does.
...
But now you know something you did not know before. You know the one question that unravels it every time. Where is your evidence?
...
......
That single question changes the entire dynamic. You are no longer the accused, sitting in that chair, taking it. You become the judge. And from that bench, you can look at the prosecution's case and see it for what it truly is. Noise dressed up as truth. Prediction dressed up as fact. A story with no evidence behind it.
...
......
Breathe in through your nose now. Wide and slow and unhurried.
[SILENCE: 5]
And let it out. Let the courtroom dissolve. The oak panels. The gallery. The soft light. Let them all go. You do not need them any more.
...
And if you want, keep one image from that room. The prosecution's table. The blank papers scattered across it. That is all it ever had.
...
......
Whenever the prosecution returns, and it will, it always does, remember this. The defence has something the prosecution never will. A record. Every time you showed up. Every time you were afraid and did it anyway. Every time the worst case did not happen. That record is long. It is growing with every day you get through. And it is yours.
...
......
When you are ready, let your eyes open. There is no rush at all. Let the room around you come back gently.
...
Thank you for practising with Salus. The defence rests.
