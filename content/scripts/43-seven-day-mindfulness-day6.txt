Take a moment to notice how you arrived here today.

...

Yesterday you opened your attention to the sounds around you. Today we go somewhere more personal. Today is about your emotions.

...

Emotions are often the hardest thing to sit with. We want to fix the difficult ones and hold on to the good ones. Today we practise something different. We just observe.

...

......

Find your position. Close your eyes when you are ready and take a few grounding breaths.

...

......

Start with the breath as your anchor. Stay here for a moment and let yourself arrive fully before we begin.

...

......

Now ask yourself a quiet question. What am I carrying right now? Not an hour ago, not this morning. Right now.

...

There might be something obvious. Frustration, tiredness, calm, restlessness. Or it might be vague, something you cannot quite name yet. Both are fine.

...

......

If you can name the emotion, try to be specific. Anxious is more useful than bad. Irritated is more useful than upset.

...

The act of naming what you experience has a measurable effect. Research shows that putting words to an emotion reduces its grip on you.

...

......

Now notice where the emotion lives in your body. Emotions are physical as well as mental.

...

Anxiety often shows up as tightness in the chest. Sadness can register as weight in the limbs. Frustration might sit in the jaw or the shoulders.

...

Where is your current experience sitting? Move your attention there gently.

...

......

Stay with that sensation. Do not try to change it or make it go away. Just sit with it and notice whether it is sharp or dull, constant or shifting, contained or spreading.

...

......

I will leave you in quiet now. Whatever you are noticing, stay with it. You do not need to change anything.

[SILENCE: 60]

...

If the emotion shifted while you were watching it, that is one of the most important things mindfulness can show you. No inner experience is permanent.

...

If it stayed the same, that is also fine. Some emotions need more time. The point is that you stayed.

...

......

There is a difference between an emotion and a reaction. The emotion arrives on its own. The reaction is what you choose to do about it.

...

Most of the time, we skip straight to the reaction. Mindfulness creates a gap between the two, just enough space to choose.

...

......

[SILENCE: 30]

...

As we move toward the close, let go of any specific focus and return to the breath.

...

Whatever you were observing, let it return to the background. The breath is your anchor, the same one you have been building all week.

...

......

Inhale slowly and fully through your nose, one last time.

[SILENCE: 4]

And release everything on the exhale, letting whatever remains be carried out with the air.

...

When you are ready, go ahead and let your eyes open gently.

...

That is Day Six. What you allowed yourself to observe today took real courage. Most people never look this closely.

...

Thank you for practising with Salus. See you tomorrow for Day Seven, the final session of the week.
