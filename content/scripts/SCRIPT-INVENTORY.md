## VERIFICATION SCRIPT

Run to check script/audio alignment:

```bash
cd /Users/scottripley/salus-website/content

# Scripts without audio
echo "=== SCRIPTS WITHOUT AUDIO ==="
comm -23 <(ls scripts/*.txt | xargs -I {} basename {} .txt | grep -v -E "(TEMPLATE|test-|INVENTORY)" | sort) <(ls audio-free/*.mp3 | xargs -I {} basename {} .mp3 | sort)

# Audio without scripts (AT RISK)
echo "=== AUDIO WITHOUT SCRIPTS (AT RISK!) ==="
comm -13 <(ls scripts/*.txt | xargs -I {} basename {} .txt | sort) <(ls audio-free/*.mp3 | xargs -I {} basename {} .mp3 | grep -v "fish-pause-test" | sort)
```
