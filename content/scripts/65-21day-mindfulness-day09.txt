You are sitting somewhere, listening to this.

...

Maybe you adjusted your position a moment ago. Maybe you are wondering what today's session is about. Maybe a part of your mind is still working through something from earlier. Right now, all of that is happening at once.

...

...

But here is the strange part. There is a voice in your head that is commenting on all of it. Not my voice. Yours. A running narration that describes, judges, plans, and reacts to everything you experience, every waking moment of your life.

...

Today you are going to meet that narrator. You are going to listen to what it says, notice how it says it, and discover something remarkable. You are not the narrator. You are the one listening.

...

...

...

This comes from a concept in psychology called metacognition, which literally means thinking about thinking. It is the ability to observe your own mental processes as they happen. And it is, without exaggeration, one of the most liberating skills a human being can develop.

...

...

Close your eyes whenever you are ready, and let the sounds around you recede gently to the background.

...

...

...

For the first minute, do nothing special. Just sit here and notice what your mind does. Pay attention to the running commentary. The thoughts about what is happening, what might happen next, what you should be doing instead of this.

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

Did you catch it? That voice has probably been running for as long as you can remember. It tells you stories about yourself, about other people, about the past and the future. It rarely stops.

...

Most people have never noticed it because they have never stepped back far enough to hear it as a voice. They just experience it as reality, as truth, as the way things are. But it is not reality. It is a commentary on reality.

...

...

...

Here is a useful exercise. For the next minute, every time you notice the narrator saying something, see if you can identify what kind of statement it is. Is it judging? Planning? Remembering? Worrying? Fantasising? Comparing?

...

You do not need to stop the narration. That would be like trying to stop the wind. Just label the type each time and let it continue.

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

If you managed to label even three or four statements, that is significant. Every time you step back and identify the type of thought, you are strengthening the distinction between the narrator and the listener. And that distinction is where all the freedom lives.

...

...

...

Now try something that might surprise you. Turn your attention to the quiet between the narrations. There are moments, however brief, where the narrator pauses. Between one thought ending and the next beginning, there is a gap. You practised finding this gap on day six.

...

But today, instead of looking for the gap in the breath, look for it in the narration itself. When one thought finishes and the next has not yet formed, what is there?

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

Whatever you found in those gaps, that quiet space between the thoughts, that is closer to who you actually are than anything the narrator says. The narrator tells stories. The awareness behind it is what hears the stories.

...

...

...

This is not a mystical claim. It is a practical observation. When you notice the narrator, something is doing the noticing. That something is not another thought. It is awareness itself. And it is always there, whether the narrator is loud or quiet.

...

...

For the remainder of this session, sit in that awareness. Let the narrator do whatever it does. Do not try to quiet it, or improve it, or argue with it. Just notice it, the way you would notice a television playing in another room. Present, audible, but not something you have to engage with.

...

...

I am going to step back now and give you this space. You and the narrator. See what happens when you stop taking its commentary personally.

[SILENCE: 120]

...

...

...

Gently let the room come back to you. The sounds, the light, the temperature of the air on your skin.

...

Open your eyes when you are ready, and notice whether the narrator has something to say about the session you just had. If it does, smile at it. You are catching it in the act.

...

...

Your homework takes three minutes, and you can do it anywhere. At some point today, tune in to your inner narrator for sixty seconds. Just listen to the running commentary without joining in. Then ask yourself one question. Who is listening?

...

...

Tomorrow, we go deeper into the stories you carry about yourself. See you then.
