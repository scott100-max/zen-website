This is your seventh day. Welcome to the final session.

...

Yesterday you sat with your emotions and observed them without reacting. Today we bring everything together.

...

Over the past six days you have built a range of skills. Finding the breath, counting, scanning the body, labelling thoughts, listening to sounds, and observing emotions.

...

Today, instead of separate exercises, we hold all of it at once.

...

......

Find your position. Let your eyes close and let your body rest into whatever support is beneath you.

...

......

Begin with the breath, as you have every day this week. Let it anchor you here.

...

......

Now, without leaving the breath, widen your attention to include your body. Notice the weight of your limbs, the temperature of the air on your skin, and any areas of tension or comfort.

...

Hold both the breath and the body in your awareness. You practised this kind of expansion on Day Five with sounds. The principle is the same, just broader now.

...

......

Now include the sounds around you. Whatever is present, let it enter your awareness without becoming the centre of it.

...

You are holding three things now. Breath, body, and sound. None of them competing, all of them coexisting.

...

......

Now let thoughts be part of the picture too. Do not follow them or label them. Just let them come and go in the wide field of your attention, the way you practised on Day Four.

...

......

This is open awareness. It is not concentration on a single object. It is a wide, receptive attention that holds everything without gripping anything.

...

There is no effort required to maintain it. If your attention narrows, gently widen it again. If a thought pulls you in, notice it and expand back out.

...

......

This is your time now. Hold everything at once. The breath, the body, the sounds, the thoughts. All of it welcome, all of it passing.

[SILENCE: 60]

...

If you managed even a few seconds of that open awareness, that is significant. It takes most people months to reach this point. You reached it in a week.

...

......

Let the open awareness soften now and return your attention to the breath alone.

...

The breath was your starting point on Day One. It has been your anchor every day since. Notice how different it is to return to it now compared to that first session.

...

......

[SILENCE: 30]

...

This week you have built something real. Not a skill you can show anyone, but a way of being present that changes how you experience everything.

...

Mindfulness is not something you finish. It is something you return to, every morning, every moment of attention, every time you come back to the breath after wandering.

...

The course is ending but the practice does not have to. Even five minutes a day is enough to keep what you have built.

...

......

As we close for the final time, inhale slowly and fully through your nose.

[SILENCE: 4]

And release everything on the exhale. Let your whole body soften.

...

When you are ready, go ahead and let your eyes open gently.

...

That is Day Seven, and the course is complete. You built something real this week. Carry it forward.

...

Thank you for practising with Salus. Take this with you.
