Right now, your mind is doing something interesting.

...

Yesterday we explored the body. Today we turn to the stream of thoughts that runs through your head all day long.

...

Thoughts are not the enemy. The aim is not to stop them or clear your mind. The aim is to change your relationship with them.

...

......

Find your position and let your eyes close. Take a few natural breaths to arrive here.

...

......

For the first minute, just sit with whatever is happening in your mind. Do not try to direct it anywhere.

...

You might notice planning, remembering, worrying, imagining. All of these are just thoughts doing what thoughts do.

...

......

Now I want you to try something. When a thought appears, see if you can name its type.

...

If you are planning something, silently say the word planning. If you are remembering, say remembering. If you are worrying, say worrying.

...

The label does not need to be precise. It just needs to be honest.

...

After you label the thought, let it go and return your attention to the breath.

...

......

I am going to step back for a while. When a thought arrives, notice it, give it a name, and let it pass.

[SILENCE: 60]

...

If that was difficult, you are not alone. Most people discover that their mind is far busier than they realised.

...

The practice is not about having fewer thoughts. It is about seeing them clearly for what they are.

...

A thought is an event in your mind, not a fact and not an instruction. It is a mental event that appears and, if you let it, passes entirely on its own.

...

......

Let go of the labelling now and return to the breath for a while.

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

Notice the difference between thinking a thought and watching one. When you are caught up in a thought, it seems like the only reality.

...

But when you step back and watch a thought arrive and leave, it starts to look more like weather passing through.

...

That shift in perspective is what mindfulness builds over time.

...

......

As we close, inhale slowly and fully through your nose.

[SILENCE: 4]

And let it go, releasing whatever thoughts are still circling.

...

When you are ready, go ahead and let your eyes open gently.

...

That is Day Four. Thoughts are visitors, not residents. You get to choose which ones you invite to stay.

...

Thank you for practising with Salus. See you tomorrow for Day Five.
