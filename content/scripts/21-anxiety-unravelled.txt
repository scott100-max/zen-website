Welcome to Salus.

Thank you for being here. I know that when anxiety is present, just sitting still can feel like an act of courage. So whatever brought you to press play — let's work with it.

...

You don't have to fix anything in the next twenty-two minutes. You don't have to make the anxiety go away. That's not what this is. This is about changing your relationship with it. Learning to sit beside it rather than underneath it.

...

Find a position that feels OK. Sitting is good. Lying down works too. Whatever lets you be here without adding more discomfort.

...

Let's start with your breath. Not because breathing is a magic fix — but because it's something real and physical that's happening right now, and it gives your mind somewhere to land.

...

Breathe in through your nose. Slowly. For a count of four. One... two... three... four.

...

Now hold, gently. Not straining. Just pausing. Two... three... four.

...

And out through your mouth. Slowly. Two... three... four... five... six.

...

That longer exhale is important. It activates your body's calm-down system. It's not a trick — it's physiology. Let's do it again.

...

In... two... three... four.

...

Hold... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four... five... six.

...

...

And once more.

In... two... three... four.

...

Hold... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four... five... six.

...

...

Good. Now let your breathing settle into whatever rhythm feels natural. You don't need to control it anymore. Just let it happen.

...

...

Now I want to talk about the anxiety itself. Here's the thing most people don't tell you: anxiety isn't the enemy. It's a signal. It's your nervous system doing its job — maybe a bit too enthusiastically, maybe at the wrong time — but it's trying to protect you. The problem isn't that it exists. The problem is that we get tangled up in it.

...

So let's untangle.

...

Right now, I want you to notice what's happening in your mind. Don't try to change it. Don't try to quiet it. Just watch.

...

There are thoughts. Probably a lot of them. Some might be specific worries. Some might be vague feelings of dread. Some might be about this meditation — wondering if it's working, wondering if you're doing it right. That's all fine. All of it.

...

...

Now here's what I want you to try. As each thought arrives, I want you to name it. Give it a simple label. Not a story, not an analysis — just a category.

A worry about tomorrow? Label it "planning."

A memory that makes you wince? "Remembering."

A judgement about yourself? "Judging."

A physical sensation — tight chest, churning stomach? "Feeling."

...

...

Just label and let go. Label and let go. The thought comes, you name it, and you let it move on. Like watching cars pass on a road. You don't need to get in any of them.

...

...

...

Let's sit with this for a while. Thoughts arrive. You notice them. You label them. You let them pass. No thought is wrong. No thought is bad. They're just thoughts. They're not instructions.

...

...

...

...

...

If you find yourself getting pulled into a thought — following its thread, spinning a story — that's OK. That's completely normal. The moment you notice it's happened, you haven't failed. You've actually succeeded. Noticing is the skill. Just label it — "thinking" — and come back.

...

...

...

...

Take a breath here. A slow one.

...

...

Now let's come to the body. Anxiety doesn't just live in the mind. It camps out in the body too. And sometimes that's where we can start to loosen its grip.

...

Bring your attention to your feet. Feel them against the ground or the bed or wherever they are. Notice the contact. The weight. The temperature.

...

This is real. This is now. Your feet, in this room, at this time.

...

Now move up to your legs. Feel their weight. Feel them being supported. They don't need to do anything.

...

...

Your hips. Your lower back. Feel yourself being held by whatever's beneath you. Let your weight sink into it.

...

...

Your stomach. If there's tension here — and with anxiety, there often is — just notice it. You don't need to fix it. Just acknowledge it. Say to yourself, "I notice tension here. That's OK."

...

...

Your chest. Notice the movement of your breathing. The gentle rise and fall. It's happening without you having to think about it. Your body is taking care of you.

...

...

Your shoulders. Your arms. Your hands. Let them be heavy.

...

Your neck. Your jaw. Let your jaw relax. Let there be space between your teeth.

...

Your face. The area around your eyes. Your forehead. Let it all soften.

...

...

You're grounded now. You're in your body. And from here, anxiety has a little less room to run the show.

...

...

Now I want to talk about something that often gets left out of these conversations. Self-compassion.

...

When we're anxious, we tend to add a second layer of suffering on top. We get anxious about being anxious. We judge ourselves for not being calm. We tell ourselves we should be stronger, tougher, more in control.

...

I want you to let that go.

...

Anxiety is not a weakness. It's not a character flaw. It's a human experience — one of the most common ones there is. And you are dealing with it. Right now, in this moment, you are actively dealing with it. That deserves kindness, not criticism.

...

...

Try this. Silently, to yourself, say: "This is hard. And that's OK."

...

...

"I'm doing the best I can. And that's enough."

...

...

"I am allowed to feel this way. And I am allowed to feel better."

...

...

Let those words settle. Even if they feel strange. Even if a part of you resists them. Say them anyway. They have a way of working even when we're not sure we believe them.

...

...

...

Now let's bring it all together. You have tools now. You have the breath — that longer exhale that tells your body to stand down. You have the labelling — the ability to watch thoughts without getting caught in them. You have grounding — the practice of coming back to the body, back to the present moment. And you have self-compassion — the choice to be kind to yourself when it would be easier to be harsh.

...

These aren't things you do once and they work forever. They're practices. They get stronger with use. And every time you come back to them, you're building something real.

...

...

Let's do one final breathing round. Slowly.

In... two... three... four.

...

Hold... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four... five... six.

...

...

In... two... three... four.

...

Hold... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four... five... six.

...

...

One more.

In... two... three... four.

...

Hold... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four... five... six.

...

...

...

The anxiety may still be there. That's OK. It might be a bit quieter now. It might have a bit less grip. And that's not nothing — that's a lot, actually.

...

...

When you're ready, start to move your fingers and toes. Gently. A small stretch if it feels good.

...

Take a natural breath.

...

Let your eyes open. Slowly. Let the world come back at its own pace.

...

You showed up for yourself today. That matters more than you might think. And whenever the anxiety starts pulling at you again, remember — you don't have to fight it. You just have to sit beside it. You've proven you can do that.

...

This has been Salus. You're going to be OK.
