Welcome to Salus.

This session is designed to prepare your mind for deep work. The kind of focused, undistracted, cognitively demanding work that produces your best results. Whether you're about to write, code, design, study, strategise, or solve a hard problem, the next twelve minutes will help you arrive at that work in the right mental state.

Let's start by getting your environment sorted. If you haven't already, put your phone on silent or in another room. Close any browser tabs you don't need. If you can, shut the door. These aren't optional extras. Research consistently shows that even the presence of your phone on your desk reduces your available cognitive capacity. So remove the temptation entirely.

...

...

Good. Now settle into your chair. Sit upright. Feet flat on the floor. Hands resting comfortably. Close your eyes.

...

Take a deep breath in through your nose.

...

And let it out slowly through your mouth.

...

Again. In.

...

And out. Feel your body starting to settle.

...

One more. Breathe in fully.

...

And release everything.

...

...

Now. Let's talk about what's in your head right now. Before you can focus on one thing, you need to stop trying to hold onto everything. So we're going to do a mental declutter. Think of it as clearing your desk before you start working.

I want you to mentally scan through everything that's on your mind. Tasks, worries, reminders, half-finished thoughts. Don't engage with any of them. Just acknowledge that they're there.

...

...

...

Now, imagine you have a notepad next to you. Mentally write down each of those things. Every last one. Get them out of your head and onto that imaginary page. You're not ignoring them. You're parking them. They'll be there when your deep work session is done.

...

...

...

Feel the space that creates. Your working memory is finite. By offloading those background processes, you've just freed up significant mental bandwidth. That bandwidth is now available for the work that matters.

...

...

Good. Now let's narrow your attention. We're going to move from a wide, scattered focus to a single, sharp point. Think of it like adjusting a camera lens. Right now, everything is in frame. We're going to zoom in until only one thing is in focus.

Start by noticing your breath. Just the simple in and out.

...

...

Now narrow your attention to just the sensation at the tip of your nose. The cool air coming in, the warm air going out. That tiny point of contact.

...

...

...

Keep your attention there. When your mind pulls you somewhere else, notice it and come back to the nose. Don't fight the thoughts. Just don't follow them. Let them pass like cars on a road while you stand on the pavement, watching.

...

...

...

...

Good. Now I want you to shift that narrowed attention to your upcoming work. Think about the specific task you're about to do. Not the whole project. Not all the things you could work on. Just the very next thing. The first action.

...

What is it? Define it clearly in your mind. Make it concrete and specific. Not "work on the report." Something more like "write the opening section" or "solve this particular problem."

...

...

Got it? Good. That's your target. For the duration of your deep work session, that's the only thing that exists.

...

Now let's prepare your mind for resistance. Because resistance will come. About ten to fifteen minutes into focused work, your brain will start looking for exits. It'll want to check email, grab a snack, suddenly remember something urgent that isn't actually urgent. This is normal. It's not a sign that you can't focus. It's your brain's default mode network trying to reassert itself.

Here's what you're going to do when that happens. You're going to notice the urge. You're going to take one slow breath. And you're going to return to the task. That's it. The urge will pass in about sixty to ninety seconds if you don't act on it. Every time you ride out that wave, your ability to sustain focus gets stronger.

...

...

Let's practise that right now. I want you to focus on your breath for the next thirty seconds. At some point your mind will wander. When it does, take one breath, and come back. Simple as that.

...

...

...

...

...

Good. That's the entire skill. Notice, breathe, return. If you do that consistently during your work session, you'll be able to sustain focus far longer than you think.

...

Now let's make a commitment. Not a vague "I'll try to focus" kind of commitment. A real one. I want you to decide right now: how long is your deep work session going to be? Pick a specific number. Thirty minutes, sixty minutes, ninety minutes. Whatever feels challenging but achievable.

...

Say that number to yourself silently. And commit to it. For that period of time, you will do nothing but the task you've defined. No switching. No multitasking. No "just quickly checking" anything. One task, one block of time, full attention.

...

...

Let's lock that in with three deliberate breaths.

Breathe in commitment.

...

Breathe out doubt.

...

Breathe in focus.

...

Breathe out distraction.

...

Breathe in readiness.

...

Breathe out hesitation.

...

...

You're prepared. Your mind is clear, your attention is sharp, and you know exactly what you're about to do. That puts you ahead of ninety per cent of people who sit down to work without any of this preparation.

Start to open your eyes. Slowly. Let the room come into focus.

...

Before you begin, take one look at your workspace. Clean, quiet, ready. Just like your mind.

...

Now open your task. Start with the first action. Go slowly at first. Let the momentum build naturally. And trust the process.

Go do your best work.

Thanks for practising with Salus. See you next time.
