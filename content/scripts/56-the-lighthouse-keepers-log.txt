The path to the lighthouse runs along the cliff edge. Short grass on one side, a long drop to the sea on the other.

...

You have walked it so many times that your feet know every uneven stone, every place where the ground dips. You could walk it in the dark. Tonight, you nearly are.

...

The sky is the colour of slate. Low cloud sitting on the headland like a lid on a pot. The air is salt and damp and moving.

...

Ahead of you, the lighthouse stands. White and cylindrical and utterly certain of itself. It has been here for a hundred and seventy years and it looks like it has no intention of going anywhere.

...

......

You reach the door. Heavy oak, painted red, with iron bolts. The key is large and simple and turns with a satisfying weight.

...

Inside, the base of the tower is round. Stone walls painted white. A table. A chair. A coat hook with a waterproof hanging from it that smells of sea spray and lanolin.

...

The air inside is cool and still. The walls are two feet thick and they hold out everything. Wind, rain, noise. Inside here, the world is reduced to stone and silence.

...

......

The stairs begin immediately. A spiral staircase wrapping around the inside wall, each step worn smooth in the centre by a century of climbing.

...

You begin to climb. Not quickly. There is no urgency in a lighthouse. The lamp does not need to be lit for another hour. You climb because climbing is what you do here. It is the rhythm of the place.

...

Step. Step. Step. The sound of your feet on stone, curving upward.

...

......

At the first landing, there is a window. Small, deep-set, with glass that distorts the view slightly. Through it you can see the sea.

...

Grey and shifting, stretching to the horizon. Waves rolling in toward the rocks below in long, unbroken lines. Each one arrives, breaks, and pulls back. The next one is already on its way.

...

The sound of the sea reaches you here as a low, continuous murmur. Not loud. Not dramatic. Just present. The way the sea always is. The background to everything.

...

......

You climb higher.

...

The second landing holds the keeper's quarters. A small room with a bed, a desk, and a window facing east. Everything you need.

...

The bed is made up with a woollen blanket, grey and heavy. The pillow is full and soft. The sheets are white and clean and smell of salt air and lavender.

...

The desk holds a logbook. Bound in dark leather, opened to today's page. A pen lies across it. The ink is the old kind, blue-black, that dries to a colour you cannot buy in a shop.

...

......

You sit at the desk and look at the log. The entries are brief. Wind direction and speed. Sea state. Visibility. Barometric pressure. The time the lamp was lit and the time it was extinguished.

...

Simple facts, recorded twice a day, for years. There is something deeply calming about a logbook. It asks only for what is true. No opinions. No interpretations. Just what happened and when.

...

You pick up the pen and write today's entry. Wind south-west, moderate. Sea state three. Visibility fair, reducing. Pressure falling.

...

The pen scratches lightly on the paper. The ink flows evenly. The act of writing by hand, in a logbook, in a lighthouse, feels like an anchor. Something that connects you to every keeper who sat in this chair before you.

...

......

You close the logbook and lean back.

...

Through the east window, the sky is darkening. The line where sea meets sky is becoming harder to see. Soon it will be indistinguishable. Just one great, grey, unbroken expanse.

...

......

You climb the last flight of stairs to the lamp room.

...

The lens is enormous. A Fresnel lens, tiered and crystalline, taking up most of the room. It catches what remains of the daylight and breaks it into fragments that scatter across the walls.

...

You light the lamp. Not with a switch. With a match, touched to a wick, which catches and grows until the flame is steady and bright behind the glass.

...

The lens takes the flame and multiplies it. What was a single point of light becomes a beam. The beam rotates, slowly, driven by a clockwork mechanism that ticks with a sound you feel more than hear.

...

......

Light sweeps across the sea. A pulse of white, three seconds on, three seconds off. The heartbeat of the headland.

...

Through the glass walls of the lamp room, you can see in every direction. The sea to the north, east and south. The headland to the west, falling away into darkness.

...

The beam reaches out across the water and disappears into the murk. Somewhere out there, a ship will see it and know where the rocks are. That is the whole point of this. One light, in the right place, doing one thing well.

...

......

You descend to the keeper's quarters.

...

The beam is above you now, rotating. You can feel the faint vibration of the clockwork through the walls. A steady pulse that becomes part of the building.

...

The room is warm. You have lit the small iron stove in the corner and it is ticking as the metal expands. The orange glow from its window is the only light in the room besides the sweep of the beam passing the east window every six seconds.

...

......

You sit on the bed and pull off your boots.

...

The mattress is firm. The woollen blanket is heavy and rough in a way that feels honest. You pull it over your legs and lean back against the pillow.

...

The logbook is closed. The lamp is lit. The watch is set. Everything that needed doing has been done.

...

......

The beam sweeps past the window. A brief flood of light, then darkness, then light again. The rhythm of it is slow and absolute and deeply hypnotic.

...

Light. Dark. Light. Dark.

...

Each sweep is identical. Each pause between them is the same length. The mechanism does not waver. It has been turning like this for decades and it will continue all night without your attention.

...

......

Outside, the wind is rising. You can hear it against the walls. A low moan that rises and falls but never quite arrives anywhere. The lighthouse does not move. Does not flex. Does not acknowledge the wind at all.

...

The sea is louder now. The waves against the rocks below have a deeper sound. A boom followed by the long hiss of water pulling back across stone.

...

Inside the keeper's quarters, these sounds are distant. Muffled by two feet of stone. Present, but held at a distance that makes them comforting rather than alarming.

...

......

The stove ticks. The beam sweeps. The wind presses against the walls and is turned away.

...

You are warm. You are dry. You are high above the water in a tower that was built to withstand anything the sea could send.

...

......

Your breathing has settled. Slow and deep. Your body is heavy against the mattress.

...

The blanket holds you. The stone holds the wind. The lamp holds the dark.

...

......

Rest here. In the keeper's quarters. In the tower on the headland where the beam turns and the sea murmurs and the logbook is closed and nothing more is asked of you.

...

......

The light will burn all night. The mechanism will turn. The rocks will be marked. None of it needs you now.

...

......

......

Thank you for practising with Salus. Sleep well.
