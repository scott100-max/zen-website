Before I say anything else, just listen for a moment.

...

......

Yesterday you worked with thoughts, watching them arrive and leave. Today we expand even further, to the sounds and space around you.

...

Every moment of your day has a soundtrack, but most of the time you are not listening to it.

...

......

Find your position and allow your eyes to close. Let your hands rest and your shoulders drop.

...

......

Start with the breath for a minute or two, just as you have practised. Let it anchor you here before we move outward.

...

...

Now, gently, let the breath move to the background and bring the sounds around you into the foreground.

...

You do not need to search for sounds. Let them come to you. Near sounds, far sounds, whatever is present right now.

...

......

Notice how sounds appear from nowhere, last for a while, and then vanish again. You did not create them and you cannot hold on to them.

...

Each sound is a moment happening in real time. When you listen this way, you are present by default.

...

Try not to label what you hear. Not traffic, or birds, or air conditioning. Just sound itself, raw and uninterpreted.

...

......

I am going to be quiet now. Let the sounds around you become your only anchor.

[SILENCE: 60]

...

Welcome back. If your mind attached stories to the sounds, that is normal. The practice is in catching yourself and returning to just listening.

...

......

Now I want you to hold two things at once. The breath and the sounds. Not choosing one over the other, but letting both exist in your awareness at the same time.

...

This is wider than what you have practised so far. It asks you to expand the container of your attention rather than narrow it.

...

......

[SILENCE: 30]

...

If holding both was difficult, that is expected. It gets easier as the week goes on.

...

Notice now how the sounds were always there. You did not create them by paying attention. You just started hearing what was already happening.

...

......

As we close, let the sounds fade gently and bring the breath back to the foreground.

...

Inhale slowly and fully through your nose, one last time.

[SILENCE: 4]

And release everything on the exhale, letting your body soften.

...

When you are ready, go ahead and let your eyes open gently.

...

That is Day Five. The world is already speaking to you. All it asks is that you listen.

...

Thank you for practising with Salus. See you tomorrow for Day Six.
