This is The Worry Window. Make yourself comfortable.
...
Worry is one of the most common forms of mental distress, and also one of the most misunderstood. Most people believe that worrying is uncontrollable, that it arrives without invitation and cannot be dismissed.
...
That is only partially true. Worry does arrive uninvited. But what happens next is more within your control than you might expect. This session will teach you a practical technique for managing it.
......
Before we begin the exercise, take a moment to settle your body where it is. Let your arms rest. Let your jaw soften. If your shoulders are up near your ears, let them drop.
...
Take two slow breaths. Not dramatic ones, just slightly longer and slower than your normal rhythm. Let each exhale last a beat longer than the inhale.
......
The technique we are going to practise is called scheduled worry. The idea comes from clinical research, and it works like this.
...
Instead of letting worry run all day in the background like a radio you cannot turn off, you give it a specific window. A fixed time, a fixed duration, a fixed place. Outside that window, worry is not invited.
...
This sounds too simple to work. But people who practise this consistently tend to notice a real reduction in the frequency and duration of their worry, often within a few weeks.
......
Here is why it works. When a worry arrives and you engage with it immediately, you teach your brain that this worry is urgent. It deserves your full attention right now, regardless of what you are doing.
...
When the same worry arrives and you acknowledge it but postpone it, you teach your brain something different. You teach it that this thought can wait. It is not an emergency. It will receive attention, but at a time you have chosen.
...
Over time, your brain learns to produce fewer urgent alarms. The volume of worry decreases because the feedback loop has changed.
......
Let us set up your worry window now. I will guide you through each step.
...
First, choose a time of day. It should be the same time every day, and it should not be close to when you go to bed. Late afternoon works well for most people. Somewhere between four and six in the evening.
...
Pick a time that suits you. You do not need to tell me what it is, just hold it in mind.
...
Second, choose a duration. Fifteen minutes is a good starting point. Long enough to give genuine attention to what is worrying you, short enough that it does not become a spiral.
...
Third, choose a place. Somewhere you can sit quietly with a pen and paper or your phone. This is not a mental exercise. When your window opens, you write your worries down. Getting them out of your head and onto a surface makes them more concrete and less overwhelming.
......
That is the setup. A time, a duration, and a place. Now let us practise what happens outside the window.
...
Think of a worry that has been present today. Something your mind has returned to more than once. Hold it lightly, just enough to recognise it.
...
Now imagine yourself saying to that worry: not right now. Not dismissed, not ignored, just postponed. You are acknowledging the thought and telling it that it has a place, but that place is your worry window, not this moment.
...
Some people find it helpful to write the worry down briefly, a single sentence, and put it aside for the window. Others just note it mentally. Either approach works, as long as the message is the same. Not right now.
......
Let us practise this a few more times. I will leave some silence, and during that silence, notice whatever thoughts arise. If any of them are worries, practise the postponement. Acknowledge them, note them if you like, and return your attention to the present moment.
[SILENCE: 40s]
How did that go? If you found it difficult, that is expected. Worry is a strong habit, and habits do not break in one session. The goal right now is to notice the pattern, not to master the technique.
......
There are a few things worth knowing as you begin to practise this on your own.
...
First, your worry window is not optional. If you postpone worries all day and then skip the window, you are just suppressing. The window is where you give those thoughts genuine attention, on paper, with honesty. That is the deal.
...
Second, when the window opens, set a timer. When fifteen minutes are up, close the window. Worry will try to overstay. The timer is your boundary.
...
Third, not every worry deserves the window. Some thoughts that arrive as worries are actually action items. If you can act on it right now in under two minutes, do it. That is not worry, that is a task. The window is for the thoughts that loop without resolution.
......
This technique pairs well with the other exercises in this collection. If you find that certain worries keep appearing in your window day after day, The Evidence Log can help you examine whether those thoughts are accurate. If worry is keeping your body tense, any of the breathing or body scan sessions can help release that tension.
......
For now, let the exercise rest. You have your window set up in your mind, and you have practised the postponement. That is enough for today.
...
Bring your attention back to the room. Notice the sounds around you, the air on your skin, the ground beneath you.
...
Open your eyes whenever you are ready, and carry the window with you. The next time a worry arrives outside that window, you know what to say. Not right now. The window is closed.
...
Thank you for taking the time to go through this exercise today.
