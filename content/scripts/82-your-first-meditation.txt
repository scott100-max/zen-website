Welcome to your very first meditation with Salus Mind.
...
If this is genuinely your first time, you might be wondering what you are supposed to do. That is a perfectly reasonable question, and the honest answer is less than you think.
...
Meditation is not about emptying your mind. That is a myth, and a damaging one, because it makes people think they have failed before they have even started. Your mind will wander. That is what minds do. The practice is in noticing when it has wandered and gently bringing it back.
...
That is the whole thing. Notice. Return. That is meditation. Everything else is just technique to make that process a little easier.
......
So let us begin with something practical. Find a position that you can hold comfortably for the next ten minutes. Sitting upright in a chair is ideal, but if lying down works better, that is fine too.
...
Rest your hands wherever they have landed. Let your shoulders lower a fraction from where they are right now.
...
Close your eyes if you are comfortable doing that. If not, lower your gaze towards a spot on the ground a few feet ahead and let it soften there.
......
Now I want you to notice something that has been happening your entire life without your attention. Your breathing. Not the idea of breathing, but the physical reality of it happening right now, in your body.
...
Where do you notice it most? Some people notice the air moving past their nostrils. Others notice the rise and fall of their chest. Some notice a gentle movement in their belly. There is no wrong answer.
...
Wherever you notice it, that is your anchor point. For the rest of this session, that spot is your home base. When your mind drifts, and it will, that is where you return to.
......
Let us stay with the breath for a moment. You do not need to change its rhythm or make it slower or more deliberate. Just watch it, the way you might watch the tide coming in from a window. It does not need your help.
...
Breathe in. Notice that. Breathe out. Notice that. That is all you need to do right now.
......
At some point in the next few moments, your mind will wander. You might start thinking about what you need to do later, or something someone said to you, or whether you are doing this correctly. All of that is normal.
...
The moment you realise your mind has wandered is not a failure. It is the practice working. That moment of noticing is the entire point. Monks who have meditated for decades still experience wandering minds. The difference is they have practised the return thousands of times.
...
So when you notice your mind has drifted, do not criticise yourself. Just gently guide your attention back to that anchor point, to the breath, to that spot where you notice it most.
......
Let us try it now in quiet. Sit with your breathing. When your mind wanders, notice it, and return. I will be quiet for about a minute.
[SILENCE: 60s]
Good. Whatever just happened was fine. If you stayed with the breath for ten seconds before drifting, that is a genuine achievement for a first session. If you drifted immediately, that is normal too. None of this is a test.
...
Let us try once more, a little longer this time. Same anchor point, same gentle return when the mind wanders. There is nothing to get right except the noticing.
[SILENCE: 90s]
Now let me share something that might be useful going forward. Most people expect meditation to produce an immediate calm, and when it does not, they assume it is not working. But the benefit is not in any single session.
...
What changes over time is your relationship with your own attention. You start to notice when your mind has hooked onto a worry or a story, and that noticing creates a small gap. A pause between the thought arriving and your reaction to it. That pause grows with practice.
...
You do not have to take my word for it. Just try it for yourself over the next few days. Even five minutes is enough.
......
For now, begin to widen your attention from the breath back to the room around you. Notice the surface beneath you, the temperature of the air, any sounds that are present.
...
When you are ready, let your eyes open gently. Take a moment before you stand or reach for your phone. Let the transition happen at its own pace.
...
That was your first meditation. Thank you for giving it a try.
