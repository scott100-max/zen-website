Something happens, and then you react.

...

That sequence runs so fast you probably think it is one step. The car cuts you off, and you are angry. The email lands, and you are anxious. Your name is called, and you are alert. Stimulus, response. Instant. Automatic.

...

...

But it is not one step. There is a gap in the middle. A tiny space between the event and your reaction, and if you can learn to find it, everything changes.

...

A psychologist named Viktor Frankl, who survived some of the worst conditions any human has endured, described it like this. Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies your freedom and your power to choose your response. He was not being poetic. He was being precise.

...

...

Today, you are going to find that gap for yourself. Not as an idea, but as an experience. And once you have found it, you will have a tool you can use for the rest of your life.

...

...

Close your eyes whenever you are ready, and let your body become as comfortable as it can.

...

...

We are going to start with something physical, because the gap is easiest to find in the body before the mind.

...

I am going to name a body part. Your right hand. Notice the small delay between hearing those words and your attention actually arriving there.

...

...

Try another. Your left knee. Same exercise. Listen for the gap between hearing the instruction and your awareness completing the move.

...

...

The back of your neck. Hear the words first, and then watch your attention travel there. The gap is always present, even when you know what is coming.

...

...

Your lower back. One more. Even now, knowing the pattern, the gap does not disappear. It is built into the way your nervous system works.

...

...

And your chest. Did you notice how the delay stayed consistent? That fraction of a second is always present. That is the space Frankl described.

...

...

...

Now let us move from the body to the breath. On your next inhale, notice the moment where the inhale finishes and the exhale has not yet started. That turnaround point. It is a natural pause built into every breath.

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

That pause at the top of the breath is not something you create. It is already there. Your body does it automatically. You are just noticing it for the first time.

...

...

Stay with the breath now, and keep your attention on that turnaround point. Inhale, pause, exhale, pause. Two gaps in every breath. Two moments of pure space.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

Good. Now let us apply this to thoughts. This is the harder version, but you are ready for it after four days of training.

...

When a thought arrives, there is a gap between the thought appearing and you engaging with it. Often this gap is so small that you miss it entirely, and you are carried away by the thought before you know it happened.

...

...

But you have been practising. You spent yesterday watching the stream. Today, your only job is to catch that micro-moment between a thought arriving and your decision to follow it. When you see a thought, pause. Do not follow it. Do not push it away. Just hover in the gap.

...

...

I am going to leave you in quiet to practise this now. Every time a thought arrives, look for the space before you react to it. That is where your freedom lives.

[SILENCE: 90]

...

...

Well done. Finding the gap even once in that time means something real has shifted. You are no longer purely automatic. You have a choice point.

...

...

Gently open your eyes when you are ready, and take a moment to look around the room before you stand up.

...

...

Your homework today takes three minutes, spread across the day. Three separate times, when you notice a reaction building, whether it is irritation, impatience, excitement, anything at all, see if you can catch the gap before the reaction completes. You do not have to change the reaction. Just notice that the gap exists. Three times. Three gaps.

...

That gap is the most powerful thing you have learned so far. See you tomorrow for day seven, where we bring everything together.
