Welcome back to Salus.

This is Day Two of your seven-day mindfulness course. You showed up again. That matters more than you might think.

Yesterday we worked with the breath. Today we're going to expand our awareness to include the whole body. This is called a body scan, and it's one of the most powerful mindfulness practices there is.

...

Here's why the body matters so much in mindfulness.

Your body is always in the present moment. Always. Your mind can wander to the past or the future, but your body is always right here, right now. So when we bring attention to the body, we anchor ourselves in the present.

There's another reason too. We store a lot in our bodies — tension, stress, emotions we haven't fully processed. Most of us are so disconnected from our physical selves that we don't even notice until something hurts. A body scan helps us reconnect.

...

So let's begin. Get into a comfortable position. Today, lying down is ideal if you can — on your back, arms by your sides, legs uncrossed. But sitting works too.

...

Close your eyes.

...

Take a few deep breaths to settle in. Breathing in through the nose.

...

And out through the mouth. Letting go.

...

One more. Deep breath in.

...

And release.

...

Now let your breathing return to its natural rhythm. No need to control it.

...

We're going to move through the body slowly, part by part. There's nothing to fix or change. We're just noticing. Bringing kind attention to each area.

...

Start with the top of your head. The crown. Just notice any sensations there. Tingling, warmth, pressure, or maybe nothing at all. Whatever you find is fine.

...

Now move your attention down to your forehead. Feel the skin there. Notice if there's any tension — any furrowing or tightness. You don't have to release it. Just notice it.

...

Move to your eyes. The muscles around your eyes. Are they soft or holding? Just observe.

...

Your jaw. This is a place many of us hold tension without realising. Notice the hinge of the jaw, the muscles. Is your jaw clenched? Are your teeth pressed together? Just notice.

...

...

Now your neck and throat. Feel the front of the throat, the sides of the neck, the back of the neck where it meets the skull. What's there?

...

Move your attention into your shoulders. We carry so much here. Feel the weight of your shoulders, the position they're in. Tight? Raised? Dropped? Just observe.

...

...

Now down into your arms. Feel your upper arms, your elbows, your forearms. Notice any sensations — or the absence of sensation.

...

Your wrists. Your hands. The palms of your hands. Your fingers, one by one if you like. What do you notice?

...

...

Bring your attention back to the centre of your body. Your chest. Feel it rising and falling with each breath. Notice the heartbeat if you can. The ribs expanding and contracting.

...

...

Move down to your belly. The soft area of the abdomen. Notice how it moves with the breath. Notice any tightness or holding. This is another place we store a lot.

...

...

Now your lower back. The base of your spine. Feel whatever is there — sensation, tension, nothing. All of it is information.

...

Your hips and pelvis. The bowl of the pelvis. Notice the weight of your body here if you're lying down.

...

...

Move into your upper legs. Your thighs. Feel the muscles there, the bones, the skin.

...

Your knees. Often overlooked, but they carry you everywhere.

...

Your lower legs. Shins and calves.

...

Your ankles. Your feet. The tops of the feet, the soles, the toes.

...

...

...

Now, expand your awareness to feel your whole body at once. Not part by part, but as one complete whole. Your entire body, lying or sitting here, breathing.

...

...

...

Feel the boundary where your body meets the air. The whole surface of your skin.

...

...

Feel the weight of your body. The places where it touches the floor or the chair.

...

...

...

Stay here for a moment. Whole body awareness. Just being present in this physical form.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Good.

...

Now, gently begin to deepen your breath. Take a fuller inhale.

...

And a longer exhale.

...

Start to bring some small movements back into the body. Maybe wiggle your fingers or toes.

...

Roll your wrists or ankles gently.

...

If you're lying down, you might stretch your arms overhead, give yourself a full body stretch.

...

Take your time. There's no rush.

...

Before you open your eyes, notice how you feel now compared to when we started. Has anything shifted? Even subtly?

...

Today's invitation is this: at some point today, pause and do a quick body check. Just thirty seconds. Notice your shoulders, your jaw, your belly. See what's there. You might be surprised what you find.

...

Gently open your eyes when you're ready.

...

Day Two — complete. You're building something real here. I'll see you tomorrow for Day Three, where we'll work with thoughts.

Thanks for practising with Salus.
