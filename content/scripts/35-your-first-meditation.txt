YOUR FIRST MEDITATION
Duration: 7 minutes
Style: Warm, grounded male narrator

This is your first meditation. And I just want to say — good for you. Seriously. The fact that you pressed play, that you're here, that's the hardest part done.

Now, here's what I want you to know right from the start: there is no way to get this wrong. None. You don't need to empty your mind. You don't need to feel anything special. You don't need to sit in any particular way — though if you can be relatively comfortable and relatively upright, that helps.

You just need to be here. That's it.

...

So let's start by settling in. Wherever you are — a chair, a cushion, your bed — just let yourself land. Feel the weight of your body pressing down. Feel whatever's beneath you holding you up.

...

You can close your eyes if that feels comfortable. If not, just soften your gaze and look down toward the floor a few feet ahead of you. Either way is fine.

...

Now take a breath. Not a big dramatic one — just a normal breath. In through the nose.

...

And out.

...

And another one. In.

...

And out.

...

Good. You're already doing it. That's meditation. Breathing and knowing that you're breathing. That's the whole thing, at its core.

...

Now, here's what's going to happen — and I want to prepare you for this because almost everyone thinks they're doing it wrong when it happens: your mind is going to wander.

You'll be following your breath, and then suddenly you'll be thinking about what you're having for dinner. Or replaying a conversation from yesterday. Or wondering if you left the oven on.

That's not a problem. That's not failure. That is completely, utterly normal. It's what minds do. Minds think. That's their job.

...

The practice isn't about stopping your thoughts. It's about noticing when you've drifted, and then gently — gently — coming back to the breath.

That moment of noticing? That's actually the most important moment in meditation. That's the rep. That's the bicep curl. Every time you notice you've wandered and come back, you're building something. You're strengthening your ability to be present.

...

So let's do that now. For the next couple of minutes, I'm going to be quiet, and your only job is to pay attention to your breathing.

Feel the air come in through your nose. Feel your chest or belly rise. Feel the air go back out. That's it.

And when your mind wanders — because it will — just notice it. No judgement. No frustration. Just a gentle, "Oh, I wandered," and then come back to the breath.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

If you've wandered off, that's okay. Come on back. Feel the next breath.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Good.

...

Now, let's start to wrap up. Keep your eyes closed for just another moment.

Take a slightly deeper breath in.

...

And let it go with a sigh if you want to.

...

Just notice how you feel right now. You don't have to label it or judge it. Maybe you feel calmer. Maybe you feel exactly the same. Maybe your mind was all over the place and you're thinking, "Well, that was a disaster."

It wasn't. I promise. Whatever happened, that was meditation. You showed up, you tried, you noticed. That's the whole practice.

...

And here's the thing — it gets easier. Not because your mind stops wandering, but because you get better at noticing, and you get better at being kind to yourself when you do.

...

When you're ready, gently open your eyes. Take a moment before you rush back into your day. Look around the room. Feel your feet on the floor.

...

You just meditated. First one done.

Thanks for practising with Salus. I'll see you next time.
