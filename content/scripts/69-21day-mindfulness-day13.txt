Stand up for this one.

...

We are going to do something different today. For the first time in this course, you are going to meditate while moving. Walking meditation is one of the oldest contemplative practices on earth. Monks in every tradition have used it, and there is a reason it survives.

...

...

Walking engages the body in a way that sitting does not. It gives restless energy somewhere to go. It brings attention into the legs and feet, parts of the body that rarely get your full awareness. And it teaches you something crucial. Mindfulness does not require you to be still. It works in motion.

...

...

You will need a clear space of about ten to fifteen paces. A hallway, a garden path, a stretch of pavement, your living room. You are going to walk back and forth along this line. If you do not have the space, you can walk in a slow circle, or shift your weight from foot to foot.

...

...

...

Stand at one end of your space with your feet hip width apart, whatever is natural. Let your arms hang loosely at your sides or clasp your hands lightly in front of you.

...

...

Before you move, just stand here for a moment. Notice the weight of your body pressing down through your legs and into the ground. Notice the micro-adjustments your ankles and feet are making to keep you balanced. Standing is not as static as it seems.

...

...

[SILENCE: 20]

...

...

Now begin to walk, very slowly. Much slower than you normally would. We are going to break each step down into three parts. Lifting the foot, moving it forward, and placing it down.

...

Lift. Move. Place. That is the rhythm. One step at a time. There is no destination.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

As you walk, bring your full attention to the soles of your feet. Notice the moment the heel lifts off the ground. Notice the sensation of the foot moving through the air. Notice the moment it makes contact again, the pressure spreading from the heel through to the toes.

...

...

This level of detail requires you to move very slowly. If you find yourself speeding up, that is your mind getting ahead of your body. Slow down. There is nowhere to get to.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

...

When you reach the end of your space, stop. Stand for a moment. Notice the impulse to turn immediately and keep going. Pause before you turn. Then turn slowly and begin walking back.

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

You have been walking at what we might call first gear. Maximum slowness, maximum attention. Now let us shift into second gear. Walk at roughly half your normal pace. Still deliberate, still aware, but with a more natural rhythm.

...

...

Notice how the quality of your attention changes. At the slowest speed, each step was a complete experience. At this pace, you need to hold a wider frame of awareness. The individual sensations blur slightly, and you are now tracking the pattern of walking rather than each micro-movement.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

Now shift into third gear. Walk at your normal everyday pace. The speed you use on the street, in the supermarket, on the way to work. Full speed.

...

The challenge now is to maintain the same quality of awareness you had at the slowest speed. It is harder. The feet move faster, the details blur more, and the mind has more opportunities to wander. But see if you can stay with the sensations, even as the pace increases.

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

Now slow down again. Gradually bring yourself back to first gear. The deliberate, microscopic pace. Lift. Move. Place.

...

...

Notice the contrast. After walking at full speed, this slow pace has a different quality than it did at the start. Your awareness may be sharper, your balance more precise. The body has warmed up to the attention.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

Come to a stop. Stand at the end of your space, and let the motion drain out of your body.

...

...

Notice the after-effects of walking meditation. Most people report that their legs are more alive, more present, than they have been all day. The feet are awake. The ground is real.

...

...

If you have room, you can sit down now, or you can remain standing. Either way, let your eyes close for the final portion of this session.

...

...

For the next few minutes, just rest in the body that has been moving. Notice what is different about your awareness compared to when you started. Movement changes the mind. That is why this practice exists.

...

...

I am going to leave you in quiet now, whether you sit or stand, eyes open or closed. Just be here in your body, in motion or in rest.

[SILENCE: 90]

...

...

...

Let your eyes open if they are closed. Take a breath, and let the room come back to you.

...

...

Your homework is to walk somewhere today at half your usual speed. Just for two minutes. It does not matter where. A corridor, a path, a pavement. Walk slowly enough that you can notice each step. Two minutes of deliberate movement in a day that is otherwise on autopilot.

...

...

Tomorrow is the final day of week two, and we are going to work with something subtle and profound. See you then.
