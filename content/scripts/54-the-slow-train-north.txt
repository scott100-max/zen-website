---
The platform is almost empty. One bench. One lamp. A clock that ticks with a sound you can hear because everything else is so quiet.

...

It is late. The kind of late where the world has narrowed down to just a few things. You. Your bag. The tracks in front of you stretching away into the dark.

...

You hear it before you see it. A low rumble from the south. Then the rails begin to hum. A thin, metallic note that grows until you can feel it through the soles of your shoes.

...

The train appears. Slowly. Two headlights in the dark, then the long shape of it pulling in alongside the platform.

...

It stops with a sigh of brakes. A proper sigh. The sound of something heavy finally resting.

...

......

The doors open and you step aboard.

...

The carriage is warm. That particular warmth of a train that has been running all day. It wraps around you the moment you cross the threshold.

...

The corridor is narrow, lined with polished wood and brass fittings. Old-fashioned in a way that feels deliberate. Chosen, not accidental.

...

Your compartment is halfway down. The door slides open on smooth runners and inside there is everything you need and nothing you do not.

...

A bed, already made up with white sheets and a heavy blanket. A small reading lamp with a warm yellow glow. A window with a blind you can lower. And silence.

...

......

You put your bag down. You take off your shoes. You sit on the edge of the bed and it gives slightly under your weight. Firm, but welcoming.

...

The sheets are clean and cool. The blanket is the kind that has real weight to it. The kind that holds you down in a way that feels safe.

...

......

There is a gentle jolt. Then another. The train begins to move.

...

Slowly at first. The platform slides past the window. The clock. The lamp. The empty bench. All of it drifting backward and away.

...

Then the station is gone and there is nothing outside but dark fields under a wide sky.

...

......

The train finds its rhythm. A steady, repeating pattern of sound and motion that you feel through the whole carriage.

...

Click. Click. Click. The wheels on the rails. Each click a joint in the track passing underneath you.

...

The rhythm is hypnotic. It has no urgency. It does not accelerate or slow down. It simply continues, reliable and constant and deeply, profoundly soothing.

...

......

You pull the blanket up and lie on your side, facing the window.

...

Outside, the countryside is moving past in the dark. You cannot see details. Just shapes. The dark mass of a tree line. The lighter grey of a field. Occasionally, the scattered lights of a village, there and gone.

...

Each one a place where people are already asleep. Warm in their houses. Safe in their beds. And you are passing through, quiet and unnoticed, heading north.

...

......

The train crosses a bridge. The sound changes. The clicks become deeper, more resonant. There is a river beneath you but you cannot see it. Only hear the difference in the sound.

...

Then the bridge is behind you and the rhythm returns to normal. Click. Click. Click.

...

......

The reading lamp throws a small circle of light across the bed. Everything beyond it is shadow. Comfortable shadow. The kind of darkness that has nothing in it except rest.

...

You reach up and turn the lamp off.

...

The compartment fills with the soft blue-grey light from the window. The world outside is not completely dark. There is moonlight, thin and even, lying across the fields like water.

...

......

The motion of the train is continuous. A gentle rocking from side to side. So slight you only notice it when you stop thinking about everything else.

...

It is the motion of a cradle, if cradles were made of steel and carried you north through sleeping countryside at forty miles an hour.

...

......

Rain begins. You hear it on the roof of the carriage first. A light tapping, irregular, almost tentative.

...

Then it settles in. A steady patter that adds a new layer to the rhythm. The clicks of the wheels. The patter of rain. The low vibration of the engine somewhere far ahead.

...

Together they make a sound that is more than the sum of its parts. A deep, complex, endlessly soothing noise that fills the compartment and empties your mind.

...

......

The blanket is heavy on your shoulders. Your head is deep in the pillow. Your body has found a position that matches the rocking of the train.

...

Every muscle has arrived at the same conclusion. There is nothing to hold on to. Nothing to brace against. Nothing to do except lie here and let the train carry you.

...

......

Towns pass in the night. You know this because the light from the window changes briefly. A glow of sodium lamps, there and gone. A level crossing. A signal box. Small details of a sleeping country.

...

Then fields again. Then trees. Then the wide, open dark of moorland where there are no lights at all.

...

......

The rain is heavier now. It runs down the window in fine lines, turning the moonlight into something liquid and shifting.

...

Inside the compartment, you are dry and warm and completely held. The train is taking care of everything. Direction. Speed. Destination. None of it is your concern.

...

......

You are heading north. That is all you need to know.

...

North, where the land gets higher and the air gets colder and the sky gets wider.

...

North, where the morning will arrive later and the light will be thinner and there will be mountains on the horizon that you have not seen before.

...

But that is for tomorrow. Right now there is only this. The rain. The rhythm. The warm weight of the blanket. The gentle, ceaseless rocking.

...

......

The wheels click. The rain falls. The train moves through the night.

...

Your breathing has matched the rhythm of the track. In with one click. Out with the next. A slow, natural synchronisation that you did not choose and do not need to maintain.

...

......

Sleep is not something you go to tonight. It is something the train carries you into. Gently. Steadily. Without asking anything from you at all.

...

The compartment is warm. The night is long. The rails go on and on and on, north through the dark, north through the rain, north through the quiet sleeping heart of the country.

...

......

Let the rhythm hold you. Let the rain cover you. Let the blanket keep you.

...

......

The train will be here all night. It knows where it is going. You do not have to.

...

......

......

Thank you for practising with Salus. Sleep well.
