This is a simple introduction to mindfulness. There is nothing complicated about it.

...

We are just going to practice paying attention together, starting right now.

...

Find somewhere comfortable to sit or lie down, and let your hands rest wherever is natural.

...

Close your eyes whenever you are ready, and allow yourself to arrive in this moment.

...

...

...

Let's start with your breath. Not because it's special, but because it's always there.

...

Don't try to change anything. Just notice the air coming in, and notice it leaving.

...

...

That's all this is. Noticing what's already happening, moment by moment.

...

...

...

Notice your chest rise slightly as you breathe in, and notice it soften as you breathe out.

...

...

Your mind will wander. That is not a problem at all.

...

When you notice it has wandered, just come back to the breath, gently and without judgement.

...

...

That moment of noticing, that is the whole practice right there.

...

...

You don't need to stop your thoughts. You just need to see them for what they are.

...

And then let them pass, like clouds moving through a wide open sky.

[SILENCE: 45]

Breathe in slowly through your nose, and breathe out gently through your mouth.

...

...

All you need to do is be right here, right now. This moment is yours completely.

...

...

If a thought pulls you away, that is absolutely fine. Just notice it happened.

...

Name it quietly if that helps. Planning. Remembering. Worrying. Whatever it may be.

...

And when you are ready, gently come back to the breath once more.

[SILENCE: 45]

You are doing this exactly right, even if it does not quite seem like it.

...

Even if nothing seems to be happening, something very real is taking place inside you.

...

...

You are building a habit of returning, of being here, in this present moment.

...

...

Let's take a few more breaths together now, gently and without any rushing.

...

Breathe in gently through your nose, allowing the warmth to enter.

...

...

And let it all go, releasing any tension that remains in your body.

...

Breathe in once more, as slowly and as naturally as you can manage.

...

...

And release everything, letting your body grow soft and completely at rest.

...

...

...

The thing about mindfulness is that it goes with you wherever you are.

...

You can do this on a bus. At your desk. Waiting for someone. Anywhere at all.

...

...

Any moment you choose to notice what is happening around you, that is enough.

[SILENCE: 30]

Now gently begin to widen your awareness and notice the space all around you.

...

Notice the sounds in the room or outside, whatever they may be right now.

...

...

Notice whatever is beneath you, how it supports you, holding your full weight.

...

The temperature of the air on your skin, and the gentle rise and fall of your breath.

...

...

Wiggle your fingers gently if you would like, and begin to reconnect with your body.

...

...

When you are ready, let your eyes open softly and take in the world around you.

...

...

...

Thank you for practicing with Salus today. Rest well, and carry this calm with you.
