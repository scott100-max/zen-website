This is a simple introduction to mindfulness.

...

There's nothing complicated about it. We're just going to practice paying attention.

...

Find somewhere comfortable to sit or lie down.

...

Let your hands rest wherever feels natural.

...

Close your eyes when you're ready.

...

...

...

Let's start with your breath. Not because it's special — but because it's always there.

...

Don't try to change anything. Just notice the air coming in.

...

...

And notice it leaving.

...

...

That's all this is. Noticing what's already happening.

...

...

...

Feel your chest rise slightly as you breathe in.

...

And feel it settle as you breathe out.

...

...

...

Your mind will wander. That's not a problem.

...

When you notice it's wandered, just come back to the breath. Gently.

...

...

That moment of noticing — that's the whole practice.

...

...

...

You don't need to stop your thoughts. You just need to see them.

...

And then let them pass, like clouds moving through.

...

...

...

[45 second pause]

Breathe in slowly through your nose.

...

And breathe out through your mouth.

...

...

There's nowhere else you need to be right now.

...

...

...

If a thought pulls you away, that's fine. Just notice it.

...

Name it quietly if that helps. Planning. Remembering. Worrying.

...

And come back to the breath.

...

...

...

[60 second pause]

You're doing this exactly right.

...

Even if it feels like nothing is happening, something is.

...

...

You're building a habit of returning. Of being here.

...

...

...

Let's take a few more breaths together.

...

Breathe in gently through your nose.

...

...

And let it go completely.

...

...

Breathe in once more.

...

...

And release everything slowly.

...

...

...

...

The thing about mindfulness is that it goes with you.

...

You can do this on a bus. At your desk. Waiting for someone.

...

...

Any moment you choose to notice what's happening — that's enough.

...

...

...

[45 second pause]

Now gently begin to widen your awareness.

...

Notice the sounds around you.

...

...

Feel whatever is beneath you.

...

...

The temperature of the air on your skin.

...

...

...

Wiggle your fingers if you'd like.

...

...

When you're ready, let your eyes open softly.

...

...

...

...

Thank you for practicing with Salus.

...

Sleep, relax, restore.
