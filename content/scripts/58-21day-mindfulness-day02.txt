Counting sounds boring.

...

Let us be honest about that. You came here for something meaningful, and I am going to ask you to count. But here is why it works, and why every serious meditator returns to it.

...

...

Counting gives your mind just enough structure to stop spinning, but not so much that it gets busy. It is the difference between an anchor and a cage. An anchor holds you in place without trapping you there.

...

Today you are going to learn breath counting. Not as a beginner exercise you will outgrow, but as a genuine tool that experienced practitioners still reach for when everything else gets complicated.

...

...

When you are ready, let your eyes close, and let your hands rest where they are.

...

...

Let your breathing find its own rhythm. Whatever pace your body wants right now is the right one. You are not going to change it, you are just going to count it.

...

...

Here is how it works. On the next exhale, count one silently to yourself. On the exhale after that, two. Then three, then four. After four, start again at one. That is the whole technique.

...

...

If you lose count, and you will, just start again at one. Losing count is not a failure, it is information. It tells you your mind wandered, and now you know, and now you are back.

...

Let us begin now. On your next exhale, quietly count one in your mind.

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

If you have been counting steadily, good. If you lost count eight times, also good. Both of those mean you were paying attention to what was happening.

...

...

Now I am going to make it slightly harder. This time, count to four on the inhales instead of the exhales. Same rules. One, two, three, four, then restart.

...

This is a different kind of attention. Exhale counting rides a natural release. Inhale counting catches the active part of the breath. Notice how the quality of your concentration shifts.

...

...

Begin on your next inhale, and stay with the count as long as you can.

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

Did you notice a difference? Most people find inhale counting requires a sharper focus. That is because the inhale is an active motion, and your mind has to work slightly harder to stay with it.

...

Neither version is better. They are different tools for different moments. When you want to settle, count the exhales. When you need to sharpen up, count the inhales.

...

...

...

For this last round, let go of the numbers entirely. Just watch the breath without counting. Notice what your mind does without that small task to keep it anchored.

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

Some people find this easier than counting. Others find their mind immediately scatters. Neither response is right or wrong. You are just learning what your particular mind does under different conditions.

...

That is what this whole course is about. Getting to know the instrument you already own.

...

...

I am going to leave some quiet now. If you want to count, count. If you want to just sit with the breath, do that instead. There is no wrong choice here.

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

Gently let your awareness widen to include the rest of your body. Your hands, your shoulders, the surface underneath you.

...

...

Let your eyes open in your own time, and bring the room slowly back into focus.

...

...

Your homework today is thirty seconds. Find a moment, any moment, and count four breaths on the exhale. One, two, three, four. That is it. You can do it at a traffic light, in a queue, at your desk. Thirty seconds and you have practised.

...

See you tomorrow, when we go somewhere interesting.
