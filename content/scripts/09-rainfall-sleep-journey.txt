Tonight, it's raining.

...

And that's a good thing. Because rain, on the right kind of night, is one of the most deeply relaxing sounds in the world.

...

There's a reason people put on rain sounds to fall asleep. Tonight, we're going to lean into that completely.

...

Get comfortable. Adjust your pillow if you need to.

...

Pull the covers up around you. Let your body find its position.

...

The one where everything feels supported. Where nothing is strained.

...

Close your eyes when you're ready.

...

...

Take a long, slow breath in through your nose.

[SILENCE: 4]

And let it all go through your mouth. Feel your body settle deeper into the mattress.

[SILENCE: 6]

One more. Nice and slow.

[SILENCE: 4]

And release everything. Let the exhale carry the last of the day out of you.

[SILENCE: 6]

Good. Now let your breathing settle on its own. No more effort. Just your body doing what it does.

...

...

Here's where you are tonight.

...

You're in a cabin. A small, simple cabin in the woods.

...

Wood and warmth and quiet. A single room with a bed and a woodstove and a big window that looks out into the trees.

...

The kind of place where time slows down.

...

...

The bed is perfect. A thick mattress, heavy blankets piled up in a way that makes you feel nested. Safe.

...

You're already settled, already warm. Your body has made a small depression in the mattress, and it fits you perfectly.

...

The woodstove in the corner is glowing. Embers and coals pulsing orange and red behind the glass door.

...

Throwing off warmth. Steady, reliable. A consistent warmth that fills the whole room.

...

...

And then you hear it. The first drops.

...

Soft. Scattered. Tapping on the roof above you like fingertips on a table.

...

Then more drops. Closer together. The tapping becomes a patter.

...

A steady patter on the wooden roof, just a few feet above your head.

...

The rain feels close. Personal. Like it came here just for you.

...

...

Let the sound fill the room. Fill your head.

...

There's nothing to think about when there's rain on the roof. It fills every silence, every gap, every space where a worry might try to creep in.

...

...

...

The rain is building now. The patter has become a steady drumming.

...

Not harsh. The patient kind of rain that falls straight down from a low sky.

...

A thousand tiny impacts per second, all blending together into that unmistakable sound of rainfall.

...

You know this sound. You've known it your whole life.

...

Rain on a roof is ancient. It says one thing. You're inside. You're sheltered. You are dry and warm and safe.

...

...

Let your body respond to that message. You don't have to do anything about the rain.

...

You just have to lie here and listen and let it make you sleepy.

...

...

Your forehead smooths out. Your eyes soften behind your eyelids.

...

Your jaw loosens. Your lips part slightly. Your face becomes completely relaxed.

...

...

The rain continues. Constant. Patient. It's not going anywhere.

...

This is an all-night rain.

...

...

...

Feel the warmth from the woodstove reaching you under the blankets.

...

That deep, radiant warmth that tells your muscles they can stop holding on to anything.

...

Feel it in your feet first. Warm and heavy and completely still.

...

The warmth moves up through your ankles and into your calves. Feel those muscles soften.

...

Your knees relax. Your thighs go heavy.

...

The large muscles of your upper legs sink into the mattress like warm clay.

...

...

Your hips settle deeper. Your lower back releases.

...

Let the mattress hold you completely. You don't need to hold yourself up any more.

...

...

Outside, the rain continues. That steady, constant, beautiful drumming.

...

It's become a texture rather than a sound. A blanket of noise that covers everything else.

...

I'm going to be quiet now for a little while. Just let the rain hold you. There's nothing you need to do.

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

Your shoulders. Let them drop now.

...

You're not carrying anything right now. So let them spread against the mattress, wide and heavy.

...

Your arms relax. Your wrists go limp.

...

Your hands. Feel your palms soften. Your fingers curl loosely. You're not holding anything.

...

...

The rain is your companion tonight. It's doing all the work.

...

The rain is the technique. The rain is the meditation. The rain is the lullaby.

...

...

Every worry. Every tension. Every thought that was still spinning when you lay down.

...

The rain is covering it all. Gently. The way a rising tide slowly covers footprints on a beach.

...

...

...

Your neck is relaxed now. Your head is heavy on the pillow.

...

Your whole body has arrived at the same place. Deep rest.

...

...

The rain is constant. Unwavering. Dependable.

...

It's just going to be here, filling the silence, filling the darkness, filling the space between you and sleep.

...

...

Let your mind drift now. You don't need to follow my words closely.

...

Just let the rain be the thing you hear.

...

Rest here now. I'll be back soon.

...

[SILENCE: 90]

...

...

The rain is still falling. Still steady. And you're still here, warm and safe and deeply relaxed.

...

Each drop on the roof is a tiny permission. Permission to let go. Permission to rest. Permission to sleep.

...

...

A thousand permissions per second, falling from the sky.

...

...

Your body is so heavy now. So deeply, beautifully heavy.

...

Everything is perfect right here. Everything is exactly where it should be.

...

...

...

You might be asleep already. That's perfect. That's the whole point.

...

If you're still here, the rain will take you the rest of the way.

...

It's patient. It has all night.

...

It's just going to keep falling until you slide, gently and completely, into sleep.

...

...

Let the drumming on the roof be the last thing you hear. Let it carry you down.

...

...

Down. Into the deep, warm dark.

...

...

Where the only sound is rain. And the only feeling is peace.

...

And the only thing to do is sleep.

...

...

...

Thank you for practicing with Salus. Sleep, relax, restore.

...

...

Goodnight. Sleep well.

...

...
