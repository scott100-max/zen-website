Tonight, it's raining.

...

And I know that might not sound like much, but stay with me.

...

Because rain, the right kind of rain, on the right kind of night, is one of the most deeply relaxing things in the world.

...

There's a reason people put on rain sounds to fall asleep. Tonight, we're going to lean into that completely.

...

Get comfortable. Adjust your pillow. Pull the covers up around you. Let your body find its position — the one where everything feels supported, where nothing is strained.

...

Close your eyes. Take a long, slow breath in through your nose. Feel your lungs expand. Feel your belly rise.

...

And exhale through your mouth. Let it all go. A long, slow release. Feel your body settle deeper into the mattress.

...

One more. Breathe in. Even slower. Even deeper.

...

And let it go. All the way out. Let the exhale carry the last of the day out of you.

...

Good. Now let your breathing settle. No more effort. Just your body doing what it does.

...
...

Here's where you are tonight. You're in a cabin. A small, simple cabin in the woods. Wood and warmth and quiet. A single room with a bed and a woodstove and a big window that looks out into the trees. The kind of place where time slows down.

...

The bed is perfect — a thick mattress, heavy blankets piled up in a way that makes you feel nested. Safe. You're already settled, already warm. Your body made a small depression in the mattress, and it fits you perfectly.

...

The woodstove in the corner is glowing. Embers and coals pulsing orange and red behind the glass door. It's throwing off warmth — steady, reliable. A consistent, unwavering warmth that fills the room.

...

And then you hear it. The first drops. Soft. Scattered. Tapping on the roof above you like fingertips on a table.

...

Then more drops. Closer together. The tapping becomes a patter. A steady patter on the wooden roof, just a few feet above your head. The rain feels close. Personal. Like it came here specifically for you.

...

Let the sound fill the room. Fill your head. There's nothing to think about when there's rain on the roof. It fills every silence, every gap, every space where a worry might try to creep in.

...
...

The rain is building now. The patter has become a steady drumming. Not harsh — the patient rain that falls straight down from a low sky. A thousand tiny impacts per second, blending together into that unmistakable sound of rainfall.

...

You know this sound. You've known it your whole life. Rain on a roof is primal. It's encoded somewhere deep in our brains. Rain on a roof says: you're inside. You're sheltered. You are dry and warm and safe.

...

Let your body respond to that message. You don't have to do anything about the rain. You just have to lie here and listen and let it make you sleepy.

...

Your forehead smooths. Your eyes soften. Your jaw loosens. Your face becomes a mask of relaxation.

...

The rain continues. Constant. Patient. It's not going anywhere. This is an all-night rain.

...
...

Feel the warmth from the woodstove reaching you under the blankets. That deep, radiant warmth that tells your muscles they can stop holding. Everything can go soft.

...

Feel it in your feet first. Warm and heavy and completely still. The warmth moves up through your ankles and into your calves. Feel those muscles soften.

...

Your knees relax. Your thighs go heavy. The large muscles of your upper legs sink into the mattress like warm clay.

...

Your hips settle deeper. Your lower back releases. Let the mattress hold you completely.

...

Outside, the rain continues. That steady, constant, beautiful drumming. It's become a texture rather than a sound. A blanket of noise that covers everything else.

...
...

Your shoulders. Let them drop now. You're not carrying anything right now. So let them spread against the mattress, wide and heavy.

...

Your arms relax. Your wrists go limp. Your hands — feel your palms soften. Your fingers curl loosely. You're not holding anything.

...

The rain is your companion tonight. It's doing all the work. The rain is the technique. The rain is the meditation. The rain is the lullaby.

...

Every worry. Every tension. Every thought that was still spinning when you lay down. The rain is covering it all. Gently. The way a rising tide slowly covers footprints on a beach.

...
...

Your neck is relaxed. Your head is heavy on the pillow. Your face is slack and easy. Just peace. Just rest.

...

The rain is constant. Unwavering. Dependable. It's just going to be here, filling the silence, filling the darkness, filling the space between you and sleep.

...

Let your mind drift now. You don't need to follow my words closely. Just let the rain be the thing you hear.

...

I'm going to be quiet now. Just let the rain hold you. There's nothing you need to do. Just breathe, and listen, and rest.

...
...
...

The rain is still falling. Still steady. And you're still here, warm and safe and deeply relaxed.

...

Each drop on the roof is a tiny permission. Permission to let go. Permission to rest. Permission to sleep.

...

A thousand permissions per second, falling from the sky. Saying yes. Saying rest. Saying sleep.

...
...

Your body is so heavy now. So deeply, beautifully heavy. Everything is perfect right here. Everything is exactly where it should be.

...

Your whole body has arrived. This bed, this cabin, this rain — this is where you were supposed to end up tonight. And here you are. Finally. Home. Safe. Done.

...
...

You might be asleep already. That's perfect. That's the whole point.

...

If you're still here, the rain will take you the rest of the way. It's patient. It has all night. It's just going to keep falling until you slide, gently and completely, into sleep.

...

Let the drumming on the roof be the last thing you hear. Let it carry you down.

...

Down. Into the deep, warm dark.

...

Where the only sound is rain. And the only feeling is peace. And the only thing to do is sleep.

...
...

Goodnight from Salus.
