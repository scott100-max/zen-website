Think of your closest friend.

...

The person you would call at two in the morning if something went wrong. The one whose face comes to mind when you think about trust. Hold them in your mind for a moment.

...

...

Now imagine they came to you and said this. I made a terrible mistake. I am not sure I can fix it. I am embarrassed, and I do not know what to do.

...

What would you say to them? Not in theory, but honestly. Would you criticise them? Would you list everything they did wrong? Would you tell them they should have known better?

...

...

Of course not. You would be kind. You would remind them that mistakes are what humans do. You would tell them that the mistake does not define them. And you would mean it.

...

...

Now think about the last time you made a mistake. A real one. Something that embarrassed you or hurt someone or fell short of what you expected from yourself. What did you say to yourself?

...

...

...

If you are like most people, you said something you would never say to that friend. You were harsher, colder, more dismissive. The double standard is nearly universal, and it is the reason we are here today.

...

...

Today you are going to learn self-compassion. Not the greeting-card version. The real thing. Developed and researched by the psychologist Kristin Neff, self-compassion has three components. Self-kindness instead of self-judgement. Common humanity instead of isolation. And mindfulness instead of over-identification.

...

...

...

Close your eyes whenever you are ready, and let your body soften wherever it can.

...

...

...

Let us start with the double standard, because it is where the change begins. Bring back to mind the friend you thought of a moment ago. Picture their face. Remember what it is about them that earns your loyalty and your care.

...

...

Now imagine again that they are sitting in front of you, telling you about something they got wrong. Something they are ashamed of. Listen to what they are saying and notice the warmth that rises in you automatically. The wish for them to be alright. The certainty that this one mistake does not erase who they are.

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

That warmth is compassion. You already know how to generate it. You have been doing it your whole life, for other people. The only thing you have not done is turn it inward.

...

...

So let us do that now. Bring to mind something you have been harsh with yourself about recently. It does not need to be the worst thing. Something medium. Something that still carries a small charge.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 15]

...

Hold that situation in your mind, and now speak to yourself the way you would speak to that friend. Not with empty reassurance. With genuine warmth. With the understanding that you are a human being who did something imperfect, and that this is not a scandal. It is a Tuesday.

...

...

If words help, try these silently. This is hard, and I am doing my best. Everyone struggles with this at some point. I do not have to be perfect to be worthy of my own kindness.

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

...

Notice what that does to your body. For most people, self-compassion produces a physical shift. The chest softens. The jaw unclenches. The shoulders drop. The body recognises kindness even before the mind fully accepts it.

...

...

This is the first component. Self-kindness. It is not about letting yourself off the hook. It is about treating your failures the way you would treat anyone else's. With perspective, with warmth, and with the knowledge that making mistakes is not optional.

...

...

...

The second component is common humanity. This is the recognition that whatever you are going through, you are not the only one. Loneliness and shame thrive on the story that you are uniquely broken. Compassion dissolves that story.

...

Right now, somewhere in the world, thousands of people are sitting with the exact same kind of regret you just brought to mind. Different details, same flavour. You are not isolated in this. You are surrounded by fellow humans doing the same messy, imperfect work of being alive.

...

...

Let that land for a moment. You are not the only one who gets this wrong. Nobody is.

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

...

The third component is mindfulness, which you have been practising for two weeks. In the context of self-compassion, mindfulness means noticing your suffering without drowning in it. You can acknowledge that something hurts without making it the whole story. You can hold the pain and the perspective at the same time.

...

...

...

For the remaining time, I am going to guide you through a brief compassion practice and then leave you in silence to let it settle.

...

Place a hand on your chest if that is comfortable. Notice the warmth of your palm against your body. This is a gesture of kindness, and your nervous system recognises it even when your inner critic resists it.

...

...

Silently, offer yourself these phrases. Adjust the words to whatever sounds natural in your own voice.

...

May I be kind to myself in this moment. May I remember that I am not alone in what I carry. May I hold this difficulty without being consumed by it.

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

You do not have to believe every word right now. Self-compassion is a practice, not a belief. It gets more natural the more you do it. And the research is clear. People who practise it regularly are not weaker or more complacent. They are more resilient, more motivated, and better at recovering from setbacks.

...

...

...

I am going to leave you in quiet now. Stay with whatever came up. If the compassion practice brought up something tender, let it be there. If it brought up resistance, let that be there too. Both are welcome.

[SILENCE: 120]

...

...

...

Gently let the room come back to you. The sounds, the light, the temperature of the air.

...

...

Open your eyes when you are ready, and let yourself arrive back in the world without rushing.

...

...

Your homework today is to catch yourself in the double standard once. The next time you criticise yourself, pause and ask one question. Would I say this to my closest friend? If the answer is no, say what you would say to them instead. Just once. That is the turn.

...

...

Tomorrow, we go even further into courage. See you then.
