Today is a little different. We're going to talk for a few minutes about how to make meditation a real, lasting habit — and then we'll do a short practice together to anchor it in.

Because here's the truth: a single meditation can be great. It can calm you down, give you a moment of peace, help you think more clearly. But the real benefits — the deep, life-changing stuff — that comes from consistency. Not from meditating perfectly, not from long sessions, but from showing up regularly.

So let's talk about how to actually make that happen.

...

First thing: start small. I know that sounds obvious, but most people skip this step. They get inspired, they commit to thirty minutes a day, they do it for three days, and then life gets in the way and they feel like they failed.

Don't do that to yourself. Start with five minutes. Seriously. Five minutes a day, every day, is infinitely better than thirty minutes once a week. You can always build up from there. But the goal right now isn't duration — it's consistency.

...

Second: tie it to something you already do. This is probably the most effective habit-building strategy there is. It's called habit stacking. You attach the new behaviour to an existing one.

So maybe it's: after I make my morning coffee, I sit down and meditate for five minutes. Or: after I brush my teeth at night, I meditate. Or: when I get to my parked car before driving to work, I take five minutes.

The existing habit becomes your trigger. You don't have to remember to meditate — the coffee reminds you.

...

Third: have a spot. It doesn't have to be a dedicated meditation room with candles and incense. It can be a corner of your couch. A chair by the window. The edge of your bed. But having a consistent place helps your brain shift into the right mode. Over time, just sitting in that spot will start to settle you.

...

Fourth — and this is a big one — don't judge your sessions. Some days your mind will be calm and focused. Other days it'll be a circus. Both are fine. Both count. A "bad" meditation is still a meditation. The only failed meditation is the one you skipped.

Think of it like going to the gym. Some days you have a great workout. Some days you just show up and go through the motions. But you still went. And over time, that consistency is what transforms you.

...

Fifth: be kind to yourself when you miss a day. Because you will. Life will happen. You'll get sick, or you'll travel, or you'll just forget. That's not the end of your practice. It's just a gap. The important thing is what you do next. Just start again. No guilt, no story about how you're bad at this. Just sit down and breathe.

...

One more thought: track it if that helps you. A simple checkmark on a calendar. A note in your phone. Some people find that a visible streak is motivating. Others find it stressful. Know yourself. Use what works.

...

Okay. So that's the framework. Small sessions. Tied to an existing habit. In a consistent spot. Without judgement. With self-compassion when you miss.

Now let's put it into practice. We're going to do about five minutes of simple breath meditation right now. Think of this as your template — the thing you can come back to every single day.

...

Settle in. Get comfortable. Close your eyes.

...

Feel your body in the chair or on the cushion. Feel the points of contact — your legs, your seat, your hands wherever they're resting.

...

Take one intentional breath. A slow inhale through the nose.

...

And a long exhale, letting everything go.

...

Now let your breathing return to its natural rhythm. You don't need to control it. Just breathe normally, and pay attention.

...

Notice where you feel the breath most clearly. Maybe it's the cool air at your nostrils. Maybe it's the rise and fall of your chest. Maybe it's the expansion of your belly. Wherever it's clearest, rest your attention there.

...

That's your anchor. When your mind wanders — and it will — this is what you come back to. The simple sensation of breathing.

...

...

...

...

...

Just breathing. Just here.

...

...

...

When your mind wanders, notice it. No frustration. Just gently come back.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

This is the practice. This is what five minutes a day looks like. Nothing fancy. Just you, your breath, and the willingness to keep coming back.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Alright. Let's start to close.

...

Take a deeper breath in.

...

And let it go slowly.

...

Before you open your eyes, I want you to make a small commitment. Not a grand resolution — just a small, specific plan. When are you going to meditate tomorrow? What's the trigger? Where will you sit?

Take a moment to decide that right now.

...

...

Got it? Good. That's your plan. One day at a time.

...

Gently open your eyes. Look around the room. Feel yourself here.

...

You've just done two important things: you've learned how to build a practice, and you've practised. That's a strong combination.

I'll see you tomorrow. Same time, same spot, same breath.

Thanks for practising with Salus.
