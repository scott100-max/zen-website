5-MINUTE RESET
Category: Focus
Duration: 5 minutes (~650 words)

Welcome to Salus.

This is your five-minute reset. Whatever has been happening in your day so far, you're pressing pause on it right now. Just five minutes. That's all you need to come back to yourself and re-engage with the rest of your day feeling clear and grounded.

So wherever you are, go ahead and settle in. You can sit upright in your chair, feet flat on the floor, hands resting in your lap or on your desk. If you can close your eyes, do that. If not, just soften your gaze and let it drop to a spot on the floor in front of you.

...

Good. Now let's start with three deep breaths. Not forced, not dramatic. Just full, deliberate breaths.

Breathe in through your nose, slowly, filling your lungs all the way up.

...

And let it go through your mouth. Let everything release with that exhale. The tension in your shoulders. The tightness in your jaw. Whatever mental noise has been running in the background.

...

Second breath. In through the nose. Feel your chest expand, your ribs widen.

...

And out. Slow and steady. Like you're deflating.

...

One more. Breathe in deeply.

...

And release. Let that exhale be longer than the inhale. Just let it all pour out.

...

...

Nice. Already your nervous system is starting to recalibrate. That's not a metaphor. Deep breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system. It's one of the fastest ways to shift your body out of stress mode. You just did it in three breaths.

Now let's do a quick body scan. We're not going to linger anywhere. Think of this as a rapid check-in. You're just noticing what's there.

Start at the top of your head. Notice any tension across your forehead, around your temples.

...

Move down to your face. Your eyes, your jaw. If your teeth are clenched, let them part slightly. Let your tongue drop from the roof of your mouth.

...

Your neck and shoulders. This is where most of us carry the day. If your shoulders have crept up toward your ears, let them drop. Roll them back gently if that helps.

...

Your chest and your back. Notice if you've been hunched forward. Sit up just a little taller. Not rigid. Just aligned.

...

Your hands. Unclench your fists if they're tight. Spread your fingers for a moment, then let them relax.

...

Your stomach. Let it soften. You don't need to hold anything in right now.

...

And down through your legs to your feet on the floor. Feel the contact. Feel the ground beneath you. Solid, stable, reliable.

...

...

Good. Now here's the final piece. I want you to set a simple intention for the next few hours. Not a to-do list. Not a goal. Just a single word or phrase that captures how you want to show up for the rest of your day.

It might be something like "focused." Or "calm." Or "one thing at a time."

...

Whatever comes to mind first is usually the right one. Hold that word in your awareness for a moment.

...

...

That's your anchor. When the noise picks back up, and it will, you can come back to that word. It's a point of reference. A way to check in with yourself without needing another five-minute break.

Alright. Let's bring you back. Start to deepen your breath again. Gently move your fingers and your toes. If your eyes are closed, let them open slowly.

...

Take a look around the room. Orient yourself. You're here. You're present. And you've got a clear intention for what comes next.

...

That's your reset, done. Five minutes well spent. Now go make the next few hours count.

Thanks for practising with Salus. See you next time.
