VIPASSANA: INSIGHT MEDITATION
Duration: 40 minutes
Style: Warm, grounded male narrator

---

Welcome to Salus.

This is a vipassana session — insight meditation. It's one of the oldest and most profound meditation practices in existence, rooted in the Buddhist tradition but entirely accessible regardless of your beliefs or background.

Vipassana means "to see clearly." The aim is direct, experiential understanding of three fundamental characteristics of experience: that everything changes, that clinging to what changes causes suffering, and that there is no fixed, solid self at the centre of it all.

That might sound abstract right now. It won't be by the end. This is an embodied, felt practice. You'll be working with real sensations in your real body. No philosophy required — just close, careful attention.

This session is designed for experienced meditators. If you're comfortable sitting for forty minutes and you have a working relationship with your breath and body, you're ready. If your legs go numb or your back aches partway through, that's not a problem — in fact, it becomes part of the practice. You'll see what I mean.

...

Let's begin. Take your seat. Find a posture that is stable and dignified — upright, but not rigid. A posture you can maintain for the full session without constant adjustment. Some discomfort is expected and fine. It becomes material for observation.

Whether you're on a cushion, a bench, or a chair — make sure your spine is self-supporting if possible. Hands resting on your knees or in your lap. Shoulders relaxed, dropped away from your ears. Chin very slightly tucked.

...

Close your eyes.

...

Take three settling breaths. Long, slow inhale through the nose.

...

Long, slow exhale.

...

Inhale again, filling the lungs completely.

...

Exhale, releasing everything — tension, expectation, the residue of whatever came before this moment.

...

One more. Breathe in.

...

And let it all go.

...

...

Now let the breath return to its natural rhythm. No control whatsoever. Let the body breathe at whatever pace, whatever depth it chooses. Your job is not to regulate the breath — only to know it.

...

...

--- PHASE ONE: CONCENTRATED ATTENTION ON THE BREATH ---

For the first phase of this practice, we'll work with the breath as our primary object of attention. This is samatha — calming, concentrating, steadying the mind. It's the foundation that makes insight possible.

I want you to bring a fresh, almost microscopic quality of attention to the breath today. Not just a vague sense of breathing, but an intimate, detailed awareness of exactly what the breath feels like in each moment.

...

Bring your attention to the nostrils. The very rim of the nostrils, where air passes in and out. This is your observation post. This small patch of skin, no bigger than a coin.

...

Feel the air entering. Notice its temperature — is it cool? Is it cold? Does the temperature change as the inhale progresses? Notice the texture of the sensation. Is it smooth? Rough? Is there a flow, a stream, a brushing quality?

...

...

Now feel the air leaving. It's warmer on the exhale. Perhaps softer. Notice the difference between the inhale and exhale sensations. They're not the same.

...

...

Stay right here. This tiny patch of sensation at the tip of the nose. See how finely you can tune your attention. How much detail can you detect?

...

...

...

...

Now, notice the very beginning of each inhale. The first whisper of air. The precise moment when stillness gives way to movement. Can you catch that transition?

...

And notice the end of each exhale. The moment the air stops flowing out. There's a gap — tiny, sometimes barely perceptible — between the end of the out-breath and the beginning of the next in-breath. A moment of stillness. Of suspension. Can you feel it?

...

...

...

...

...

The mind will wander. You know this well by now. When it does, note what pulled you away. Use a light, one-word label: "thinking." "Planning." "Remembering." "Hearing." "Imagining." The label should be whisper-soft — a gentle acknowledgement, not a loud announcement. Then return to the breath. Return to the nostrils.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Every time you notice the mind has wandered and you bring it back, you're strengthening concentration. You're building the stability of attention that vipassana requires. So don't resent the wandering. Each return is a repetition. Each return makes the mind a little sharper, a little more willing to stay.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Continue with the breath. Let your concentration settle and deepen. Let the breath become vivid, detailed, alive — a constantly changing stream of sensation that you're observing with care and precision.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Good.

...

--- PHASE TWO: BODY SENSATIONS AND THE PRACTICE OF INSIGHT ---

Now we're going to shift. We're moving from focused attention on the breath to a wider, more investigative awareness of the body. This is where the vipassana practice truly begins. We're moving from samatha — concentration — into vipassana — insight.

...

Expand your attention from the nostrils to include the entire body. Instead of zooming in on one small point, zoom out. Feel the whole body sitting here as one field of sensation.

...

...

Take a moment to sense the body globally. What is the overall feeling of sitting here right now? You don't need words for it. Just a felt sense. The body as a whole, alive with sensation.

...

...

Now, we'll do a slow, careful scan from the top of the head to the tips of the toes. Move your attention systematically through the body, the way a searchlight sweeps across a landscape. Not rushing. Not seeking anything in particular. Just moving through and noticing whatever sensations are present in each region.

Start at the very crown of the head. What do you feel? It might be tingling, warmth, pressure, pulsing, nothing at all. Whatever is there — or isn't — just notice it clearly.

...

...

Move to the forehead. Feel the skin of the forehead. The muscles beneath it. Is there tension? Smoothness? Warmth?

...

The temples. The area around the eyes — the eyelids, the eye sockets.

...

...

The cheeks. The nose. The area around the mouth. The jaw. Notice if there's clenching or holding here. Don't try to release it — just see it. Know it's there.

...

...

The ears. The back of the head. The base of the skull.

...

The neck. The throat. These areas often hold tension we're barely conscious of. What's here?

...

...

The shoulders. For most people, there's a lot of information here. Tightness, holding, fatigue. Whatever you find, just observe it with the same curiosity you'd bring to any other sensation.

...

...

Down the right arm. Upper arm. Elbow. Forearm. Wrist. Hand. Fingertips. Notice the aliveness in the hands — they're rich with nerve endings, often tingling or pulsing.

...

...

Down the left arm. Upper arm. Elbow. Forearm. Wrist. Hand. Fingertips.

...

...

The upper chest. Feel the breathing here — the subtle movement, the expansion, the contraction. But also notice whatever else is present. Openness, tightness, warmth, pressure.

...

...

The upper back. The mid-back, along the spine. Vertebra by vertebra, if you can sense that finely. The lower back — is there aching here? Tension? Fatigue?

...

...

...

The belly. Soft or hard? Tense or relaxed? Moving with the breath, like a slow bellows?

...

...

The hips. The pelvis. The sitting bones pressing into the cushion or chair. Feel the weight there.

...

...

Down the right thigh. The right knee — there may be complex sensations here, especially if you're sitting cross-legged. The right shin. The right calf. The right ankle. The right foot. The toes.

...

...

...

Down the left thigh. The left knee. The left shin. The left calf. The left ankle. The left foot. The toes.

...

...

...

Good. Now, having surveyed the whole body, I want you to shift into a different mode of attention. Instead of scanning methodically from point to point, let your attention rest in an open field. You're sitting with awareness available to the entire body simultaneously, and you're simply noticing whatever sensation is most prominent — whatever calls for attention in each moment.

...

This is the heart of vipassana. You're observing sensations as they arise, exist for a time, and pass away. You're not looking for particular sensations. You're not trying to relax or to feel good. You're observing reality as it is, moment by moment.

...

...

Something will draw your attention. A pulse somewhere. An itch. A throb. A tingling. An ache. Heat. Coolness. Pressure. Vibration. When a sensation stands out — when it "calls" to you — turn your full attention toward it.

...

...

Observe it closely. Intimately. What exactly does it feel like? Is it sharp or dull? Does it have clear edges, or is it diffuse and vague? Is it constant, or does it fluctuate in intensity? Does it intensify when you look at it, or does it dissolve under attention?

...

...

...

Does it have a size? A shape? A temperature? I'm not asking you to think about these things — I'm asking you to feel them directly. What is the raw, uninterpreted experience of this sensation?

...

...

...

And now, watch what happens to it. It will change. It always changes. It might intensify and then fade. It might shift from one quality to another — from sharp to dull, from hot to cool. It might migrate to a different part of the body. It might dissolve entirely, leaving nothing where it was.

Stay with it and watch. This is direct observation of impermanence — anicca. Not as a Buddhist doctrine, but as a fact you can verify for yourself in this very moment.

...

...

...

...

...

When that sensation fades or your attention is naturally drawn elsewhere, follow it. Move to the next prominent sensation. The next thing that calls for your attention. Turn toward it with the same quality of curious, non-reactive investigation.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

This is the practice: meeting each sensation — pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral — with clear, equanimous awareness. Not grasping at what feels good. Not pushing away what feels bad. Not checking out when things are boring. Just observing. Just seeing clearly.

...

...

...

...

Now, I want to bring your attention to something subtler. As you observe sensations, start to notice your reactions to them. There's the sensation — and then there's your relationship to the sensation. These are two different things.

...

When something pleasant arises — warmth, tingling, a feeling of ease or openness — there's often a subtle grasping. A wanting more of it. A hoping it will last. A leaning toward it. Can you feel that reaction? It may be very faint. Very subtle. But it's there.

...

...

...

And when something unpleasant arises — pain, tension, itching, restlessness, pressure — there's often a subtle aversion. A pulling away. A wanting it to stop. A wishing it were different. A tightening around it. Can you feel that reaction?

...

...

...

And when a sensation is neither pleasant nor unpleasant — just neutral, ordinary, unremarkable — there's often a subtle boredom. A checking out. A dullness. Attention drifts because there's nothing exciting to hold it. Can you notice that pattern?

...

...

These three reactions — grasping, aversion, and ignoring — are the habitual patterns that, according to the insight traditions, create most of our suffering. Not the sensations themselves, but our relationship to them. We want what's pleasant to last forever. We want what's unpleasant to go away immediately. And we sleepwalk through everything in between.

The practice is to observe the sensation AND the reaction. To see both with equal clarity. And in that seeing — that clear, compassionate seeing — something begins to loosen. The reaction doesn't have to run you. You can feel the pull of grasping without grasping. You can feel the push of aversion without pushing away.

...

...

...

...

...

--- PHASE THREE: OPEN AWARENESS AND EXTENDED SITTING ---

Let's sit now in open awareness for an extended period. I'll offer very little guidance. Your job is simply to observe. Whatever arises — sensation, thought, emotion, sound, impulse — notice it, notice your relationship to it, and notice its passing.

Arising. Existing. Passing away. The three phases of every experience. Over and over and over.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

If you're lost in thought, the moment you notice is the moment you're back. Note "thinking" and return to direct experience — to the body, to sensation, to what's actually happening right now.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

If discomfort arises — and it likely will in a long sit — meet it with curiosity rather than resistance. Turn toward it. What exactly does the discomfort feel like? Where is it? How big is it? Does it change from moment to moment?

Often, when we look at pain directly, we find it's not one solid, fixed thing. It's a constellation of smaller sensations — heat, pressure, pulsing, tightness — all in flux. The "pain" is a concept we've layered on top of a changing reality. Look beneath the concept. See what's actually there.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

You might notice moments where the boundary between observer and observed becomes less defined. Moments where there's just sensation arising in awareness, without a strong sense of someone watching it. A collapsing of the distance between "me" and "experience." If that happens, don't grab at it. Don't try to hold it. Just let it be — and notice that too.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Notice impermanence. Not as an idea — as a lived, felt, undeniable truth. Every sensation you've observed in this session has changed or ended. Every thought has arisen and dissolved. Every emotion has come and gone. Every moment of discomfort has shifted. Every moment of peace has shifted. Nothing you've experienced has remained unchanged for more than a few seconds.

This is not a depressing observation. It is, perhaps, the most liberating one. If everything passes, then nothing — no pain, no difficulty, no state of mind, no circumstance — is permanent. And if nothing is permanent, then clinging to any of it is not only futile but unnecessary. You can feel what you feel, fully, and know it will change. You can be where you are, fully, and know you won't be here forever.

That's freedom. Not freedom from experience — freedom within it.

--- CLOSING ---

Let's begin to close.

...

Bring your attention back to the breath. After the wide-open field of vipassana, this will feel like coming home to something familiar and steady. Just the simple, ancient sensation of air moving in and out of the body. The breath that has been here all along, underneath everything else.

...

...

...

...

Feel the breath at the nostrils again. That reliable anchor. The cool air entering. The warm air leaving.

...

...

...

...

Take a deeper breath in. Expand the lungs fully.

...

And exhale completely. Empty the lungs.

...

...

Now, gently widen your awareness to include the whole body sitting here. Feel the posture. Feel the points of contact with the chair or cushion. Feel the room around you — the sounds, the temperature, the space.

...

...

Before you open your eyes, take a moment to acknowledge what you've just done. You've spent forty minutes bringing careful, non-reactive, compassionate attention to the raw reality of your experience. That is not a small thing. It takes courage to look at things as they are, without flinching, without turning away, without needing them to be different.

That quality of seeing — clear, steady, equanimous — is not limited to the meditation cushion. It is available to you in any moment. When something difficult arises in your relationships, your work, your inner life — you can turn toward it with the same presence you've practised here. You can observe it. Feel it fully. And know, from direct experience, that it will change. That it will pass. That you can be with it without being consumed by it.

That's the insight of vipassana. Not a concept you read in a book. A truth you've felt in your body.

...

...

Gently open your eyes. Let the visual world return. Move slowly. Ease back into your day with the same quality of attention you've been practising.

...

...

Thanks for practising with Salus. Carry this clarity with you.
