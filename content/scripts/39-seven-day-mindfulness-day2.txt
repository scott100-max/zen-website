You came back. That already says something good about you.

...

Yesterday you found the breath. Today we take that a step further, and use it as a real anchor.

...

When your mind wanders, the breath is what you return to. It is always there, always moving, always available.

...

......

Find your position. Sitting or lying, same as yesterday or somewhere new, it does not matter.

...

Close your eyes when you are ready, and take a moment to let the outside world fade.

...

......

We are going to count breaths today. It gives your attention a gentle structure to hold on to.

...

Start with one on the next inhale. Two on the exhale. Three on the following inhale. Keep going up to ten.

...

If you lose count, start again at one. There is no failure in starting over.

...

......

Breathe in gently through your nose, and count that as one.

[SILENCE: 4]

Breathe out slowly, that is two. And in again, three.

[SILENCE: 6]

Continue on your own now. Count each breath up to ten, then start again from one.

...

......

I will be quiet for a little while. Keep counting, and start again at one whenever you lose track.

[SILENCE: 30]

...

Welcome back. If you lost count, that is completely normal. Most people lose track within the first few breaths.

...

The counting is not the goal. The counting is a frame that helps you notice when your mind has left.

...

Each time you notice and return, you are training your attention. That is real, measurable progress.

...

......

Let go of the counting now. Let your breathing continue at whatever pace it has found.

...

Without the structure, your mind may wander more quickly. That is fine. Just notice when it happens and come back.

...

The breath is your anchor. Not a chain holding you in place, but a point you can always return to.

...

......

Notice the quality of the breath right now. Is it shallow or full? Quick or slow? There is no right answer.

...

Whatever it is doing, let it continue. Your only task is to stay close to it.

...

...

As we close, let your attention expand gently outward, from the breath to the body, from the body to the room.

...

Notice the surface beneath you and the sounds around you.

...

When you are ready, go ahead and let your eyes open gently.

...

That is Day Two. The breath will always be there waiting for you, no matter what else is happening.

...

Thank you for practising with Salus. See you tomorrow for Day Three.
