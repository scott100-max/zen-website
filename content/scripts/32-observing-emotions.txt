Welcome to Salus.

Today we're going to practise something that might feel a little uncomfortable at first: sitting with our emotions. Not fixing them. Not pushing them away. Not getting swept up in them. Just observing. Being present with whatever we're feeling.

This matters because most of us have a complicated relationship with our emotions. We chase the good ones and run from the difficult ones. We distract ourselves. We numb. We overthink. And all of that is understandable — but it keeps us from actually understanding what we feel and why.

Research in psychology consistently shows that the simple act of noticing and naming an emotion reduces its intensity. It's called affect labelling. When you can say "I'm feeling anxious" rather than just being anxious, something shifts. You create space between you and the feeling. So that's what we're going to practise.

Find a comfortable seat. Close your eyes.

...

Let's settle in with a few breaths. Slow inhale.

...

Slow exhale.

...

Again. In.

...

Out.

...

...

Start by connecting with your body. Do a quick, informal scan. Notice the sensations present right now. Not looking for emotions yet — just sensations. Warmth, coolness, tension, tingling, heaviness, lightness. What's the body telling you?

...

...

...

...

Now, gently ask yourself: what am I feeling right now? Not what should I be feeling. Not what was I feeling earlier. Right now. In this moment. What's the emotional weather?

...

There might be something clear and obvious. Or it might be vague — a mood that's hard to name. Or you might feel relatively neutral. All of that is fine. Just notice whatever is present.

...

...

If you can identify an emotion, see if you can name it. Be specific. "Anxious" is more useful than "bad." "Wistful" is more useful than "sad." "Irritated" is more useful than "angry." See if you can find the precise word. And if you can't, that's okay too. Even "something uncomfortable" or "something pleasant" is a start.

...

...

...

Now, here's the key part. Find where that emotion lives in your body. Emotions aren't just mental — they're physical. Anxiety might show up as tightness in your chest or butterflies in your stomach. Sadness might feel like heaviness in your limbs or a lump in your throat. Anger might be heat in your face or clenched fists.

Where is your current emotion sitting? Move your attention there.

...

...

...

Stay with that sensation. Don't try to make it go away. Don't try to understand why it's there. Just be with it. Feel its texture. Is it sharp or dull? Constant or pulsing? Large or small? Does it have edges, or does it bleed into surrounding areas?

...

...

...

...

You might notice that the emotion shifts as you pay attention to it. It might soften. It might intensify briefly before settling. It might move to a different part of your body. That's all fine. Emotions are not static. They move and change. That's important to remember — no feeling is permanent.

...

...

...

...

If the emotion is difficult — if it's something you'd normally avoid — see if you can stay with it just a little longer than is comfortable. Not to torture yourself. But to prove to yourself that you can sit with discomfort without being destroyed by it. That you can feel something hard and be okay.

...

...

...

...

And if it becomes too much, you always have your breath. Come back to the breath, ground yourself, and when you're ready, approach the emotion again. This isn't about pushing yourself past your limits. It's about gently expanding them.

...

...

...

...

Now, notice your relationship to the emotion. Are you resisting it? Wishing it would go away? Are you attached to it — telling yourself a story about why you feel this way? See if you can let go of the story and just be with the raw feeling.

Emotions are like weather. They come and go. You don't need to explain the rain. You just notice it's raining.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Let's try something. Whatever emotion is present, silently say to it: "I see you. You're welcome here." Not because you enjoy the feeling. But because it's here, and fighting it takes more energy than allowing it.

...

...

...

...

...

...

As we move toward the end of this practice, take a moment to appreciate what you just did. You sat with your inner life without running from it. That takes real courage. And the more you do it, the more you'll find that emotions lose their power to overwhelm you. They're still there. They still matter. But you can be with them without being controlled by them.

...

...

Take a deep breath in.

...

And breathe out.

...

...

Let your attention come back to the room. The sounds around you. The surface beneath you.

...

Open your eyes gently.

...

As you go about the rest of your day, see if you can check in with yourself now and then. What am I feeling? Where is it in my body? What would I call it? That's the practice. And it gets easier every time.

Thanks for being here. I'll see you next time on Salus.
