Today we are going to practise something that might seem uncomfortable at first. Sitting with our emotions. Not fixing them. Not pushing them away. Just observing.
...
Most of us chase the good emotions and run from the difficult ones. We distract ourselves. We overthink. Research shows that the act of noticing and naming an emotion reduces its intensity. So that is what we will practise today.
...
Find a comfortable seat. Close your eyes if that works for you.
...
......
Slow inhale through your nose, letting your chest open wide.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out through your mouth. Let your shoulders drop on that exhale.
...
One more. In through your nose, wider this time, taking your time with it.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out. Let your breathing return to whatever rhythm it wants.
...
......
Start by connecting with your body. Notice the sensations present right now. Warmth, coolness, tension, tingling, heaviness, lightness.
...
......
Now ask yourself: what am I experiencing right now? Not what was present an hour ago. Right now. What is the emotional weather?
...
There might be something obvious. Or it might be vague. Just observe whatever is present. If you can name it, get specific. Anxious is more useful than bad. Irritated is more useful than angry.
...
......
Now find where that emotion lives in your body. Emotions are physical. Anxiety might show up as tightness in your chest. Sadness might register as heaviness in your limbs. Where is your current emotion sitting? Move your attention there.
...
......
Stay with that sensation. Do not try to make it go away. Just sit with it. Is it sharp or dull? Constant or pulsing? Does it have edges, or does it bleed into surrounding areas?
...
...
You might notice the emotion shifts as you pay attention to it. It might soften. It might intensify briefly. It might move. That is important to remember. No inner experience is permanent.
...
...
If the emotion is difficult, see if you can stay with it just a little longer than is comfortable. Not to punish yourself. But to show yourself that you can sit with discomfort and come through it.
...
And if it becomes too much, come back to the breath. Ground yourself. When you are ready, approach the emotion again.
...
......
Notice your relationship to the emotion. Are you resisting it? Telling yourself a story about why it is here? Emotions are like weather. They come and go. You do not need to explain the rain. You just notice it is raining.
...
...
Whatever emotion is present, silently say to it: I see you. You are welcome here. Not because you enjoy the experience. But because fighting it takes more energy than allowing it.
...
...
As we come toward the end, appreciate what you just did. You sat with your inner life without running from it. That takes courage.
...
Breathe in wide through your nose and hold for a moment.
[SILENCE: 4]
And let it all go on the exhale. Let everything that needs to leave, leave.
...
Let your attention come back to the room. The sounds around you. The surface beneath you. Open your eyes when you are ready.
...
As you go about your day, check in now and then. What am I experiencing? Where is it in my body? What would I call it? That is the practice.
...
Thank you for practising with Salus. Go gently out there.
