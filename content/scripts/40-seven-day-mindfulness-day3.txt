Today we give your body the attention it deserves.

...

Yesterday you worked with the breath as an anchor. Today we expand that attention to the body itself.

...

You will not need to scan from head to toe. We are going to choose two or three areas and spend real time with each one.

...

......

Find your position. Let your eyes close when they are ready, and allow your weight to rest fully on whatever is beneath you.

...

Take a few breaths to arrive. Inhale through your nose, and let the exhale come naturally through your mouth.

...

......

Let your breathing find its own rhythm. No counting today, just the natural rise and fall.

...

......

Bring your attention to your hands. Both of them, wherever they are resting right now.

...

Notice the weight of them. The temperature. Whether they are warm or cool, tense or relaxed.

...

You might notice a faint pulse in your fingertips, or a tingling along the palms. Or nothing particular at all, and that is fine too.

...

Stay with your hands for a few more breaths. There is no rush to move on.

...

......

Now shift your attention to your shoulders and the back of your neck.

...

This is where most people carry the day. Tension gathers here without us noticing, building quietly for hours.

...

You do not need to release anything. Just notice what is there. Is it tight, heavy, warm, numb? Whatever you find, acknowledge it.

...

Stay with this area. Breathe into it if that image helps, directing each inhale toward whatever you are noticing.

...

......

I am going to leave some quiet now. Rest here with the body for a while. I will guide you back when the time comes.

[SILENCE: 30]

...

Now bring your attention to your chest and belly. The centre of the body, where the breath lives.

...

Notice the movement here. The gentle rise on each inhale, and the softening as you exhale.

...

This area responds to everything we carry. It tightens under anxiety and opens when we are calm. Right now, just notice what state it is in.

...

...

With your next few breaths, widen your awareness to include the whole body at once.

...

Not focusing on any one part, but holding the body as a single field of sensation. All of it present, all of it welcome.

...

......

Notice how different this is from your usual relationship with your body. Most of the time we only notice it when something hurts.

...

This kind of quiet attention is a gift you can give yourself at any time.

...

...

As we close, let the body awareness gently fade into the background.

...

Notice the sounds around you. The weight of the air on your skin.

...

Inhale slowly and fully through your nose, taking your time.

[SILENCE: 4]

And release it completely, letting everything soften.

...

When you are ready, go ahead and let your eyes open gently.

...

That is Day Three. Your body knows how to rest. You just reminded it.

...

Thank you for practising with Salus. See you tomorrow for Day Four.
