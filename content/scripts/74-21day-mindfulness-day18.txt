Think of a conversation that went wrong.

...

Not the worst one. Not the argument that ended a relationship. Something more recent, more manageable. A disagreement with a colleague. A misunderstanding with someone you care about. A moment where you said the wrong thing, or said the right thing in the wrong way.

...

...

Hold it in your mind for a moment. Just the outline of it. Who was there, what was said, how it ended.

...

...

Today you are going to learn interpersonal mindfulness, the practice of bringing everything you have learned in this course into the space between you and another person. This is where mindfulness stops being a private hobby and starts changing your life in ways other people can actually see.

...

...

...

Most of our suffering does not happen in isolation. It happens in relationships. The argument with a partner. The tension with a parent. The colleague who triggers you every time they open their mouth. These interactions are where our habits run fastest and our awareness collapses first.

...

...

Close your eyes, and let your body find a comfortable position.

...

...

...

Let us start by going back to that conversation. The one that went wrong. Not to relive it, but to study it with the skills you have now.

...

...

Bring the scene to mind. Where were you standing or sitting? What was the other person's face doing? What words were being exchanged? Let the memory come back with as much detail as you can recover.

...

...

...

...

Now, instead of replaying it from the inside, step back and watch it from the outside. You are the observer now, not the participant. Watch yourself in that conversation the way you would watch two people on a park bench. Without judgement, without taking sides. Just watching.

...

...

Notice the moment it turned. Every difficult conversation has a hinge point, the moment where it went from conversation to conflict. Something was said, or misheard, or assumed. Notice what that was.

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

Now bring your attention to what was happening in your body at that hinge point. Not what you were saying, but what you were experiencing physically. Your chest tightening. Your voice changing pitch. Your jaw clenching. The moment the nervous system shifted from conversation mode to defence mode.

...

...

That shift, from open to defensive, is what happens when mindfulness leaves the room. And it happens to everyone. The question is not whether it happens, but how quickly you notice it.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

Now here is the skill. Replay the conversation one more time, but this time, at the hinge point, imagine yourself pausing. Not externally, you do not have to freeze mid-sentence. But internally. The pause you learned on day six. The gap between stimulus and response.

...

...

In that pause, you notice three things. What am I experiencing in my body right now? What story is my mind telling about this person? And what do I actually want from this conversation?

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

Those three questions are the core of interpersonal mindfulness. Body, narrative, intention. When you can check all three in the space of a breath, you stop reacting and start responding. The difference between the two is everything.

...

...

...

Let the specific memory fade now, and let us work with the principles directly.

...

...

The first principle is somatic awareness. Your body knows you are in conflict before your mind admits it. If you learn to read the physical signals, the tightening, the heat, the shallow breathing, the clenching, you get an early warning system that gives you time to choose your response.

...

...

Scan your body right now and notice what your baseline is. Calm, restless, tense, open. Know what normal is so you can recognise when it shifts during a conversation.

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

The second principle is narrative awareness. In every difficult conversation, your mind is generating a story about the other person. They are being unreasonable. They never listen. They are doing this on purpose. These stories arrive instantly and seem like facts. They are not facts. They are interpretations.

...

...

The skill is catching the story and holding it lightly. Not believing it automatically, but not dismissing it either. Just noticing it as one possible version of events. There are always others.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

The third principle is intention clarity. Most difficult conversations go wrong because neither person is clear about what they actually want. You think you want to be right, but actually you want to be heard. You think you want an apology, but actually you want to know the relationship is safe.

...

...

Before you enter any important conversation, one question cuts through everything else. What do I actually need from this?

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 20]

...

...

For the remaining time, I am going to guide you through a brief rehearsal. Think of a conversation you expect to have in the near future. Something that might be difficult. It could be today, this week, whenever.

...

...

Imagine the beginning of that conversation. The setting, the other person, the topic. Now, before the first words are even spoken, check in. Body, narrative, intention. What is happening in my body? What story is already forming? What do I actually want from this?

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

Now imagine the conversation unfolding. At the first sign of tension, the first shift in your body, practise the internal pause. Three breaths. Body, narrative, intention. Then respond from that place.

...

...

You do not need to imagine the conversation going perfectly. You just need to practise the pause. The pause is the practice. Everything good that follows comes from that one moment of awareness.

...

...

...

I will leave you in quiet now to continue this rehearsal, or to sit with whatever came up during the session. There is no wrong direction from here.

[SILENCE: 150]

...

...

...

...

Gently let the rehearsal fade and bring your attention back to this room, this moment, this body.

...

...

...

Open your eyes when you are ready, and notice how you are holding yourself.

...

...

Your homework is one of the most practical in the course. Before your next important conversation, any conversation where something real is at stake, pause for three breaths first. During those three breaths, check in. Body. Narrative. Intention. What is happening in my body? What story am I carrying? What do I actually want? Then begin.

...

...

Three days left. See you tomorrow for something that might surprise you.
