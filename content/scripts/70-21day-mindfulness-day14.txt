Some things are pleasant right now.

...

And some things are not. Maybe your back is a bit stiff. Maybe the temperature is not quite right. Maybe there is a sound that grates slightly. Take a second and notice both. Something pleasant, and something unpleasant.

...

...

But here is what is interesting. Right now, the vast majority of your experience is neither pleasant nor unpleasant. It is neutral. The weight of your clothes on your skin. The air in the room. The sensation of your tongue resting in your mouth.

...

...

Neutral experience covers about ninety percent of any given moment, and almost nobody notices it. The mind skips right past neutral on its way to pleasant and unpleasant. That is why most people's emotional lives swing constantly between good and bad. They are missing the enormous middle ground where most of life actually happens.

...

...

Today you are going to reclaim that middle ground. This practice is called equanimity, which is the ability to remain balanced and present regardless of whether what is happening is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. It is one of the most researched qualities in contemplative science, and it changes everything about how you experience a normal day.

...

...

...

Close your eyes, and take a few breaths to arrive wherever you are.

...

...

...

We are going to sort your current experience into three categories. Not to judge them, but to see them clearly. Think of three buckets. Pleasant. Unpleasant. Neutral.

...

Start by noticing something pleasant. It might be the softness of what you are sitting on, or the warmth of your hands, or a sound you enjoy. Anything that registers as even mildly agreeable.

...

...

When you find it, notice what your mind does. Watch for the pull. The wanting it to continue, the subtle grasping, the wish that this sensation would stay. That pull is how the mind responds to pleasant experience. It reaches for more.

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

Now shift to something unpleasant. A stiffness, a tension, a noise that irritates. Anything that registers as even mildly disagreeable.

...

Notice what the mind does here. Watch for the push. The wanting it to stop, the subtle resistance, the wish that this sensation would go away. That push is how the mind responds to unpleasant experience. It tries to get rid of it.

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

And now, the harder one. Find something neutral. A sensation that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant. The temperature of the air on your forearms. The pressure of your feet against the floor. The sensation of your eyelids closed.

...

...

Notice what the mind does with neutral. Usually, nothing. It loses interest. It wanders off to find something more stimulating. Neutral experience is invisible to a mind that has been trained to chase pleasant and avoid unpleasant.

...

...

But stay with it. Keep your attention on this neutral sensation. Notice how rich it actually is when you give it your full awareness. There is detail here. Texture, temperature, weight, motion. It is not blank. It is just quiet.

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

...

Now here is the equanimity practice. You are going to let all three categories exist simultaneously, without preferring any of them. Pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral, all present at the same time, all equally valid, none of them more important than the others.

...

This is harder than it sounds. The mind will keep reaching for the pleasant and pushing away the unpleasant. Your job is to notice each time it does that, and then return to the balanced middle. Not chasing, not resisting. Just here.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

The Buddhist word for this balance is upekkha. It does not mean indifference. It does not mean you stop caring. It means you can be present with all of it without being thrown around by it. The pleasant does not make you grasp. The unpleasant does not make you recoil. You stay centred, and from that centre, you can respond with clarity instead of reflex.

...

...

...

For the next several minutes, practise holding this balance. Let whatever arises be what it is. Notice the pull, notice the push, and come back to the middle. Not once, but again and again. This is the training.

...

...

I am going to leave you in quiet now. Hold the middle ground. Let everything be exactly what it is.

[SILENCE: 150]

...

...

...

...

Gently begin to let the room back in. The sounds, the temperature, the light behind your eyelids. No rush at all.

...

...

Open your eyes when you are ready, and notice whether the room looks any different from this balanced perspective.

...

...

Your homework is five minutes, and it is one of the most interesting exercises in the course. At some point today, sit quietly and notice only neutral sensations. Not the pleasant ones, not the unpleasant ones. The ones in between.

...

The sensation of the chair against your legs. The air on the back of your hand. The weight of your jaw. See how many neutral sensations you can find in five minutes. Most people are stunned by how much they have been missing.

...

...

You have completed week two. You now know how to work with emotions, narratives, discomfort, difficulty, movement, and balance. Next week, we go where it all leads. See you on day fifteen.
