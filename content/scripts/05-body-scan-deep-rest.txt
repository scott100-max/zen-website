Tonight, we're going to do something simple and deeply restful. We're going to move through your entire body, piece by piece, and let every part of you settle into complete relaxation.

There's no effort required. No right or wrong way to do this. You just listen, and your body will do the rest.

...

So let's begin by getting comfortable. Shift around in your bed until you find a position that feels right. Maybe on your back, maybe on your side. Whatever feels natural tonight. There's no correct position for this — just the one that makes you feel most at ease.

...

Pull the covers up to where they feel good. Let your hands rest wherever they want to rest.

...

And close your eyes.

...

Take a long, slow breath in through your nose. Feel the air filling your lungs. Feel your chest expand. Feel your belly rise.

...

Hold it for just a moment.

...

And let it all go through your mouth. A big, easy exhale. Like setting down something heavy.

...

Good.

...

Let's do that once more. A deep breath in, filling your lungs all the way. Let your ribs stretch. Let your belly expand.

...

Hold it.

...

And release. Let your breath carry out any tension, any tightness, anything you've been holding onto today. Let the exhale take it all.

...

And one more time. Slow and deep. In through the nose.

...

Hold it gently. No strain.

...

And out through the mouth. All the way out until your lungs are empty. Until your body is still.

...

Now let your breathing settle into its own rhythm. You don't need to control it. Just let it breathe you. Your body has been doing this since the moment you were born. It doesn't need your help. It just needs your permission to relax.

...
...

We're going to start at the very top of your head and work our way down, slowly, all the way to the tips of your toes. And by the time we reach the bottom, you're going to feel like you're melting into your mattress.

There's no rush. We have plenty of time. And wherever your mind wanders during this, just gently bring it back to whatever body part we're visiting. No judgment. Just a gentle redirect.

...

So bring your attention to the top of your head. The crown. That very highest point.

...

You might not think of it as a place that holds tension, but it does. Just by noticing it, you can feel it start to soften. Like a warm hand resting gently on the top of your head, radiating warmth downward.

...

Feel that warmth spread across your scalp. Moving slowly from the crown outward, across the top of your head, down toward your temples. Imagine it like warm water being poured slowly over the top of your head, spreading in all directions.

...

Your scalp relaxing. Every tiny muscle letting go. The skin of your scalp loosening. You might even feel a slight tingling — that's relaxation arriving.

...

Now bring your attention to your forehead. This is where so much of the day gets stored. The furrowing, the concentrating, the thinking. Your forehead has been working hard — every time you focused, every time you worried, every time you squinted at a screen.

...

Let your forehead smooth out completely. Imagine it widening, softening, becoming perfectly still and calm. Like a lake with no wind. Perfectly smooth. Perfectly flat.

...

Feel that relaxation move down into your eyebrows. Let them drop. Let the space between your eyebrows widen. There's a small muscle right there, between your brows, that's almost always active. Let it turn off. Feel the release when it does — like unclenching a fist you didn't know was closed.

...

Your eyes now. Behind your closed eyelids, your eyes have been working hard all day. Scanning screens, reading, watching, focusing. They've been moving constantly — left to right, near to far, all day long.

...

Let them rest. Let your eyeballs feel heavy in their sockets. Let them sink back slightly. There's nothing left to look at. Nothing left to see. Your eyes are closed, and they can stay closed, and that is such a relief.

...

The muscles around your eyes — the tiny muscles that squint and strain, the muscles that crinkle when you smile or concentrate — let them all release. Feel the skin around your eyes go smooth and soft.

...

Even behind your eyelids, your eyes might be darting around. That's okay. Just notice it, and gently invite them to be still. Let them find a comfortable resting position. Maybe slightly downward, as if you're gazing softly at your own cheeks from behind closed lids.

...
...

Move your attention to your cheeks. Let your cheekbones feel heavy. Let your face go slack. Your cheeks hold expression all day — smiling, talking, reacting. They can rest now. No expression needed. Just the natural weight of your face, relaxing downward.

...

Your jaw. This is a big one. So many of us clench our jaws without realizing it. All day long, through stress and concentration and even in our sleep, the jaw tightens. Right now, let your jaw drop slightly. Let your teeth part. There should be a small gap between your upper and lower teeth. Let your lips rest together softly, or let them part just a little.

...

Feel the hinge of your jaw on both sides, right in front of your ears. Those joints have been working all day — talking, chewing, clenching. Let those joints loosen. Let your jaw hang. Feel the relief of that release. It's bigger than you'd think.

...

Your tongue. Let it fall away from the roof of your mouth. You might not have realized it was pressed up there, but it probably was. Let it rest, thick and heavy, at the bottom of your mouth. No words to form. Nothing to say. Nothing to swallow. Just a heavy, relaxed tongue resting quietly.

...

Your throat. Let it open and soften. Feel the relaxation pour down from your jaw, through your throat, like warm honey. Slow and thick and soothing. Your throat opens wider. The muscles on either side of your windpipe relax.

...
...

Now your ears. You don't need to listen hard to anything. My voice will find you. You don't need to strain toward it or concentrate on it. Just let your ears relax. Let the sounds of the room become distant and unimportant. Even my words — let them wash over you. You don't need to remember them. You don't need to think about them. Just receive them.

...

The back of your head where it meets the pillow. Let it be heavy. Really heavy. Sink the full weight of your head into the pillow. Let the pillow hold you completely. You don't need to hold your head up anymore. The pillow has it. Trust it. Let go.

...

Your neck. This is a part of the body that almost never gets to fully relax. All day long, it's supporting the weight of your head — ten, twelve pounds of bone and brain. That's a lot of work.

Roll your attention slowly down the back of your neck. Feel each vertebra. Each small bone stacked on top of the next. Let the muscles on either side of your spine soften. Let your neck lengthen and release.

...

The sides of your neck. Those ropy muscles that tighten when you're stressed. Let them loosen. Let them go slack. Down to where your neck meets your shoulders. That junction where so much stress accumulates. Where you carry the weight of responsibility and worry without even knowing it.

...

Let it melt. Just let all of it melt, like ice in warm water. Feel the tension dissolving. Draining downward. Leaving.

...
...

Your shoulders. Right now, even though you're lying down, there's a good chance your shoulders are slightly lifted, slightly tense. It's such a habit that we don't even notice it anymore. So right now, consciously, let them drop. Let them fall toward the mattress. Let gravity have them completely.

...

Feel your shoulders widen. Feel the space between your shoulders and your ears increase. That distance — that widening gap — is the physical manifestation of letting go. Feel it grow. That's good. That's where they belong.

...

And notice how different your neck feels now that your shoulders have dropped. Everything is connected. When the shoulders release, the neck releases more. When the neck releases, the jaw releases more. It cascades.

...

Now your right shoulder. Focus just on the right side. Feel it sink deeper into the bed. Heavy and warm. Feel the ball of the shoulder joint — that round socket — loosening. Opening.

...

And from your right shoulder, let that relaxation flow down into your right upper arm. Like warm water flowing downhill. The muscles of your bicep, your tricep — let them go soft. They're not holding anything. They're not supporting anything. Your arm is just resting on the bed, doing absolutely nothing, and that's perfect.

...

Down to your right elbow. That hinge joint. Notice how, even lying still, there might be a slight bend, a slight tension. Let it be loose and easy. Let the joint feel like it could move in any direction, but chooses to be still.

...

Your right forearm. Feel the muscles that run along the top and bottom of your forearm. All those small muscles that grip and type and carry things and open doors and hold phones throughout the day. There are dozens of individual muscles in your forearm, and every one of them can let go right now. Let them all switch off. One by one. Or all at once. However they want to release.

...

Your right wrist. Let it go limp. The tendons that cross your wrist — let them slacken. Your wrist is a bridge between your arm and your hand, and right now, nothing needs to cross that bridge.

...

And your right hand. Feel your palm soften and open slightly. The muscles in the pad of your thumb releasing. The muscles along the edge of your palm releasing. Your fingers uncurling, just barely. Each finger — your thumb, your index finger, your middle finger, your ring finger, your little finger — each one heavy and warm and perfectly still. They held so many things today. They've earned this rest.

...
...

Now shift your attention to your left shoulder. Let it drop, just like the right one did. Sinking down into the mattress. Heavy. Warm. Released.

...

Your left upper arm. Soft and heavy. Muscles releasing. The same warm, downhill flow of relaxation pouring from shoulder to arm.

...

Down past your left elbow. Loose and easy. No tension in the joint. No holding.

...

Your left forearm. Letting go of every grip, every hold, every small effort of the day. All those tiny muscles — off duty now. Clocked out. Done.

...

Your left wrist. Limp and relaxed.

...

And your left hand. Palm softening. Fingers loosely curled. Thumb, index, middle, ring, little finger. All heavy. All still. All done for the day. Nothing to grasp. Nothing to hold. Nothing to do.

...
...

Bring your attention back to the center of your body. Your chest.

...

Feel your chest rise and fall with each breath. Don't change anything about your breathing. Just notice it. The gentle rise. The gentle fall. It's like watching waves on a calm beach. In and out. Rise and fall. The most natural rhythm in the world.

...

With each exhale, your chest relaxes a little more. The muscles between your ribs softening. Your ribcage settling. The breastbone resting. Each breath is a little surrender. A little release. A little more letting go.

...

Your heart is beating in there. Steady and reliable. It's been beating all day, all night, your entire life, without you having to think about it. It started before you were born and it hasn't stopped for a single second since. Thank it silently. And let the area around your heart feel warm and open. Like a small sun burning gently in the center of your chest.

...
...

Now your upper back. The area between your shoulder blades. This part of your body carries a lot. The weight of sitting, of standing, of holding yourself upright all day. The tension of leaning forward — over a desk, over a phone, over a steering wheel.

...

You don't have to hold yourself up anymore. The bed is doing that for you. So let your upper back spread out against the mattress. Let it flatten and widen and release. Feel the muscles on either side of your spine softening. Feel your spine itself settling deeper into the mattress.

...

Feel each vertebra in your upper spine. Feel the muscles on either side of your spine letting go, one by one, like buttons being undone on a shirt. Starting at the top, near your neck, and moving downward. One by one. Releasing. Opening.

...

Moving lower now. Into your middle back. That area behind your stomach. Let it relax into the mattress. Feel the natural curve of your spine being supported. The bed curves with you. It holds you exactly as you are.

...

And your lower back. For a lot of us, this is where the deepest tension lives. The lower back is the foundation. It supports the weight of your upper body all day long. It bends and twists and absorbs shock with every step you take.

...

So give it permission to stop working. Let your lower back sink down. If there's a small arch, let it release. Feel the warmth spreading through your lower back, loosening every muscle, every fiber, every knot that's been building there for hours or days or weeks. It can all let go now. Every bit of it.

...
...

Your stomach now. Your belly. Let it be soft. Let it be round. There's no need to hold it in or tighten it. No one is looking. No one is judging. Just let your belly relax completely, the way it wants to.

...

Feel it rise and fall with your breath. Soft and easy. Like a sleeping child's belly. Completely at peace. Completely natural. This is how your body is meant to breathe — from the belly, soft and full and easy.

...

Your hips. Your pelvis. This is the base of your torso, and it carries more tension than you'd think. Your hips are where your upper body meets your lower body, and they take strain from both directions.

Let your hips feel heavy against the mattress. Let your pelvis tilt naturally, finding its most comfortable position. No holding. No adjusting. Just resting.

...

Feel the hip joints — those deep, round sockets — loosening. Opening slightly. Releasing. These are the biggest joints in your body, and when they relax, you can feel it everywhere. A deep, structural release that makes your whole body feel more grounded.

...
...

Now let's move into your legs. Starting with your right leg.

...

Your right thigh. The big muscles of your upper leg — the quadricep on top, the hamstring underneath. These are some of the largest muscles in your body, and they've carried you everywhere today. Every step, every stair, every time you stood up from a chair. They've been working nonstop.

...

They can rest now. Let your right thigh go completely heavy. Like it's sinking into the mattress. Like the muscle is made of something dense and warm — clay, or sand, or warm dough. Feel it spread slightly against the mattress as every fiber releases.

...

Your right knee. Let the joint feel loose. No need to lock or hold. The kneecap rests softly. The tendons around the joint slacken. If you could see inside the joint, you'd see space opening up between the bones. Room to rest.

...

Your right shin and calf. The calf muscle releasing. The shin relaxing. These muscles are the unsung heroes of your day — keeping you balanced, absorbing impact, propelling you forward. Let your lower leg feel like it's made of sand — heavy, warm, formless. Like it could pour through the mattress.

...

Your right ankle. Let it go limp. Let your foot fall slightly to the side if it wants to. That's your ankle telling you it's relaxed. When the ankle lets go, the foot naturally rotates outward slightly. That's a good sign. That's surrender.

...

The top of your right foot. Feel the small bones and tendons there relaxing. The arch of your right foot — let it soften. The sole of your right foot. All day, the soles of your feet have been pressed against shoes, against floors. Let them expand. Let them breathe. Let them soften.

...

And your right toes. Each one relaxing. Big toe, second toe, middle toe, fourth toe, little toe. All of them letting go. Warm and heavy and still.

...
...

Now your left leg. Your left thigh.

...

Feel those strong muscles — the ones that have been working all day — finally switch off. Your left thigh sinking down, heavy, warm, completely supported by the bed. Feel the muscle go dense and soft, like warm clay pressed against the mattress.

...

Your left knee. Loose and easy. The joint opening. The tension draining.

...

Your left shin and calf. Releasing all that tension. All that effort. Every step of the day stored in those muscles, now flowing out. Heavy and warm. Sinking down.

...

Your left ankle. Going limp. Your left foot falling gently to the side, just like the right one did.

...

The top of your left foot. The arch. The sole. All softening. All releasing. All done.

...

And your left toes. Each one relaxing. Big toe, second, middle, fourth, little toe. Done. Released. At rest. Ten toes, all accounted for, all at peace.

...
...
...

Now take a moment to feel your entire body all at once. Don't scan from part to part — try to feel everything simultaneously. Your whole body, from head to toe, as one complete unit.

...

From the crown of your head to the tips of your toes, you've let go of everything. Your body is heavy and warm and completely supported. The mattress holds you. The pillow holds you. The covers keep you warm. You are held from all sides.

...

You are sinking. Slowly, gently, sinking deeper into the bed. Like the mattress is made of clouds. Like you're resting on something that has no bottom — just endless softness, endless support.

...

With each breath out, you sink a little more.

...

A little deeper.

...

A little more relaxed.

...

And with each breath in, you barely rise at all. The sinking is winning. Gravity is winning. Rest is winning.

...
...

If any part of your body still holds a trace of tension — and it's okay if it does — just breathe into it now. Send your breath to that spot, wherever it is. Imagine your breath as warm light, flowing to that area, surrounding it, softening it. And on the exhale, let the tension dissolve. Like sugar in warm water. Just melting away.

...

Breathe into it once more.

...

And let it go.

...
...

Your body is completely at rest now. There is nowhere to go. Nothing to do. Nothing to figure out. No problem that needs solving. No task that needs completing. No person who needs you right now.

Your only job right now is to lie here and feel how good it feels to let go.

...

Each breath takes you deeper.

...

Deeper and heavier.

...

The sounds of the room are fading. Whatever you can hear — the hum of a heater, the creak of a house, the distant sound of traffic — it's all getting further away. Quieter. Less important.

...

My voice is becoming softer.

...

More distant.

...

Like someone speaking from the far end of a long, quiet hallway. The words are reaching you, but just barely. And that's fine. You don't need to hold onto them. Let them pass through you like a warm breeze.

...
...

You are drifting now. Somewhere between waking and sleeping. That gentle, hazy place where thoughts lose their edges and time loses its meaning. Your body is asleep even if your mind is still hearing these words. That's fine. That's perfect. That's exactly the way it's supposed to work.

...

Let your mind go where it wants to go. If thoughts come, let them pass like clouds on a slow wind. You don't need to follow them. You don't need to understand them. You don't need to engage with them at all. Just let them drift by. They'll be gone in a moment, replaced by nothing, replaced by quiet, replaced by rest.

...

You are safe. You are warm. You are held.

...
...

The night is long and generous, and there's nothing waiting for you but rest. Deep, dreamless, beautiful rest. The kind of rest that heals. The kind that restores. The kind that makes tomorrow feel possible and manageable and even good.

...

Your body knows how to do this. Every cell, every muscle, every organ knows how to rest and repair and renew. You don't have to manage the process. Just get out of the way. Just let it happen.

...

So let yourself go.

...

Let yourself fall.

...

Like a leaf from a tree on a windless day. Slowly. Gently. With no resistance.

...

All the way down.

...

Into sleep.

...
...
...

[gentle silence]

...
...
...

Sleep well tonight. Your body has let go. Your mind has let go. Everything is exactly as it should be. Every part of you is resting. Every part of you is at peace.

...

Goodnight from Salus.

...
