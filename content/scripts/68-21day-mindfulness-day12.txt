Imagine your mind is a house with a front door.

...

Every emotion you experience is a visitor. Some of them are welcome. Joy walks in and you hold the door wide open. Curiosity gets a warm reception. Excitement is invited to stay as long as it likes.

...

...

But some visitors are not welcome at all. Anxiety knocks and you pretend you are not home. Anger bangs on the door and you lock the deadbolt. Sadness sits on your doorstep for days and you step over it every time you leave.

...

...

Today you are going to practise something counterintuitive. You are going to open the door to the difficult guests and invite them in. Not because you want them there, but because they are already there, and fighting to keep them out takes more energy than letting them sit for a while.

...

...

...

This practice has roots in a teaching that is almost eight hundred years old. A poet named Rumi wrote about the human experience as a guest house, where every morning a new arrival comes. His advice was radical then and it is radical now. Welcome them all. Even the ones who sweep your house empty of its furniture.

...

Why would you do that? Because every difficult emotion carries information. Anxiety tells you something matters to you. Anger tells you a boundary was crossed. Sadness tells you something of value has been lost. When you shut the door on these visitors, you lose access to what they came to tell you.

...

...

...

Close your eyes, and let your body get comfortable wherever you are.

...

...

...

Take a few breaths and let the day recede for a moment. You are not going anywhere. Nothing needs to be done except what we do right here.

...

...

Now, gently scan your emotional state. Not what you think you should be experiencing, but what is actually here. Is there anything unwelcome in the house right now? Even something small. A background hum of worry. A residual irritation from something earlier. A tiredness that sits heavier than it should.

...

...

If something is there, name it quietly to yourself. Anxiety. Frustration. Grief. Boredom. Loneliness. Whatever it is. Name the guest.

...

[SILENCE: 20]

...

...

Now here is the practice. Instead of tightening against that visitor, instead of pushing it toward the door, imagine yourself turning toward it. Pulling up a chair for it. Saying, alright, you are here. Have a seat.

...

This does not mean you approve of the emotion. It does not mean you want it to stay forever. It means you are choosing to stop spending energy resisting its presence.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

Notice what happens when you stop resisting. For most people, the emotion either softens, shifts, or reveals something underneath itself. Anger might soften to reveal hurt. Anxiety might shift to reveal concern for someone you care about. The surface emotion is often just a disguise for something more vulnerable underneath.

...

...

Stay with whatever has revealed itself. Bring the same gentle curiosity you have been building all week. Where is this in my body? What is it actually made of? What does it want me to know?

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

You are doing something most people never do. You are looking directly at the thing that is uncomfortable and asking it what it came here for, instead of slamming the door and hoping it leaves.

...

...

...

Now imagine that same front door of your mind is wide open. Not because you are fearless, but because you have discovered that the difficult guests are not as dangerous as you thought. Most of them just want to be acknowledged. Once they are seen, they tend to move on in their own time.

...

...

Sit for a while now with the door open. Let whatever wants to arrive, arrive. Let whatever wants to leave, leave. You are the host, not the doorman. You do not have to control the traffic.

...

...

I am going to be quiet now. Just sit in the house with the door open and see who comes and goes. There is nothing to fix and nobody to turn away.

[SILENCE: 120]

...

...

...

Gently begin to close the session by noticing the room around you. The temperature, the sounds, the surface underneath your body.

...

...

When you are ready, let your eyes open softly. Take a moment before you move.

...

...

Your homework is a single gesture, and you can do it the next time a difficult emotion arrives. Instead of tightening against it, silently say to it, you are welcome here, have a seat. That is it. One phrase. One open door. See what changes when you stop fighting the guest.

...

...

Tomorrow, you are going to get up and move. Bring comfortable shoes. See you then.
