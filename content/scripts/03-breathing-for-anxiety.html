  <h2>Intro — Why Breathing Works (0:00–2:00)</h2>
  <p class="direction">[Zenscape chime. Clean visuals — text on screen: "Breathing for Anxiety Relief"]</p>
  <p>Welcome to Zenscape. If you're feeling anxious right now, I want you to know: you're in the right place. And you're going to feel better.</p>
  <p>Here's something worth understanding. When you're anxious, your body activates its fight-or-flight response — your heart rate increases, your breathing gets shallow, and your muscles tense. This is your nervous system trying to protect you.</p>
  <p>But here's the key: your breath is the one part of this system you can control consciously. When you slow your exhale, you activate the vagus nerve, which signals your brain to switch from "alert mode" to "rest and digest" mode. It's not a trick. It's biology.</p>
  <p>Today I'm going to teach you two breathing techniques you can use anywhere, anytime. Let's begin.</p>

  <h2>Technique 1 — Box Breathing (2:00–6:30)</h2>
  <p class="direction">[Text overlay: "Box Breathing" — show a square graphic that traces each side during the counts.]</p>
  <p>The first technique is called box breathing. It's used by everyone from Navy SEALs to therapists because it works quickly and reliably.</p>
  <p>The pattern is simple: breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, breathe out for 4, hold for 4. Four equal sides — like a box.</p>
  <p>Let's try it. Sit comfortably. Let your shoulders drop.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 3 seconds</span>

  <p><span class="count">Breathe in:</span> 2... 3... 4.</p>
  <p><span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4.</p>
  <p><span class="count">Breathe out:</span> 2... 3... 4.</p>
  <p><span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 3 seconds</span>

  <p>Good. Let's do three more rounds together.</p>

  <p><span class="count">In:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Out:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 2 seconds</span>
  <p><span class="count">In:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Out:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 2 seconds</span>
  <p><span class="count">In:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Out:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 5 seconds</span>

  <p>Notice how you feel. Even after a few rounds, most people report feeling noticeably calmer. That's the vagus nerve doing its job.</p>

  <h2>Technique 2 — 4-7-8 Breathing (6:30–10:30)</h2>
  <p class="direction">[Text overlay: "4-7-8 Breathing" — visual counter on screen.]</p>
  <p>The second technique was developed by Dr. Andrew Weil and is particularly effective for acute anxiety and falling asleep.</p>
  <p>The pattern: breathe in through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 7, and exhale slowly through your mouth for 8. The long exhale is what activates your relaxation response.</p>
  <p>Let's practise. Place the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, just behind your front teeth. Keep it there throughout.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 3 seconds</span>

  <p><span class="count">Breathe in through your nose:</span> 2... 3... 4.</p>
  <p><span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7.</p>
  <p><span class="count">Exhale through your mouth:</span> 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 3 seconds</span>

  <p>Let's do that three more times.</p>

  <p><span class="count">In:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7. <span class="count">Out:</span> 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 3 seconds</span>
  <p><span class="count">In:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7. <span class="count">Out:</span> 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 3 seconds</span>
  <p><span class="count">In:</span> 2... 3... 4. <span class="count">Hold:</span> 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7. <span class="count">Out:</span> 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8.</p>
  <span class="pause">Pause — 5 seconds</span>

  <p>Beautiful. You might feel a little lightheaded — that's normal when you first practise. It passes quickly.</p>

  <h2>Closing — When to Use These (10:30–12:00)</h2>
  <p>You now have two tools that are always with you. Here's when to use each:</p>
  <p>Box breathing is best for in-the-moment calm — before a meeting, during a stressful conversation, or whenever you feel your chest tightening.</p>
  <p>4-7-8 breathing is ideal for winding down — before sleep, after a long day, or when anxious thoughts are spiralling.</p>
  <p>Start with four rounds and build up as it feels comfortable. The more you practise, the faster your body responds.</p>
  <p>You showed up for yourself today, and that matters. I'll see you next time on Zenscape.</p>
  <p>Sleep. Relax. Restore.</p>
