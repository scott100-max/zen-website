Welcome back to Salus.

Day Four. More than halfway now. You're doing something most people never do — actually building a practice.

We've worked with breath, body, and thoughts. Today we go deeper — into emotions.

...

Emotions are tricky. Most of us have two default responses to difficult feelings: we either push them away or we get completely lost in them. We suppress or we drown.

Mindfulness offers a third way. We learn to be with emotions — to feel them fully without being overwhelmed by them. We hold them with awareness instead of being held hostage by them.

...

This is maybe the most valuable skill you can develop. Not to feel less, but to feel with more space. More perspective. More choice about how you respond.

...

Let's begin. Find your position. Sitting is good for this work.

...

Close your eyes.

...

Take a few deep breaths. Settling in.

...

Let your breathing become natural.

...

...

First, let's establish a foundation. Bring your attention to your body. Feel your feet on the ground. Feel your seat in the chair. Feel your hands wherever they're resting.

...

This body, this moment, right here. You're safe. You're grounded.

...

...

Now, I want you to think of something that's been causing you some low-level stress or frustration. Not your deepest pain — we're not going there today. Just something mildly difficult. An annoyance. A worry. A situation that's been bothering you.

...

Bring it to mind. Let yourself think about it for a moment.

...

And now, shift your attention from the story — from what happened or might happen — to your body. Where do you feel this emotion physically?

...

Scan your body. Is there tightness in your chest? A knot in your stomach? Tension in your shoulders? Heat in your face?

...

Find where the emotion lives in your body. It's there somewhere.

...

...

Now, this is the key move. Instead of thinking about the situation, bring your attention directly to the physical sensation. Just feel it. Explore it with curiosity.

What shape is it? Is it large or small? Does it have edges or is it diffuse? Is it static or does it move?

...

...

...

Breathe into that area. Not to make the sensation go away, but to give it space. Imagine your breath flowing to that part of your body, creating room around the sensation.

...

...

...

Notice — you're feeling the emotion, but you're not drowning in it. You're observing it. You're bigger than it. The awareness holding the emotion is vast, open, untroubled.

...

...

...

See if you can bring a quality of kindness to the sensation. Like you're sitting with a friend who's having a hard time. You don't need to fix anything. Just be present with what's there.

...

...

...

...

...

Often, when we simply allow emotions to be felt without resistance, something shifts. Not always — but often. The sensation may soften, move, or change. Or it may stay the same. Either is fine. We're not trying to achieve any particular result.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Now, let the story and the sensation both fade. Return your attention to your breath. Simple breath. In and out.

...

...

...

Take a deeper breath in.

...

And exhale, letting everything go.

...

What you just practised is emotional intelligence in action. Instead of reacting automatically to a feeling, you observed it. You made space for it. You were with it without becoming it.

...

This is a skill you can use anytime. When anger rises, when anxiety spikes, when sadness comes — you can always pause, find it in the body, and hold it with awareness.

...

Today's invitation: when a difficult emotion shows up, see if you can catch it early and ask — where do I feel this in my body? That simple question changes everything.

...

Gently open your eyes.

...

Day Four — complete. Tomorrow we're going to move — literally. Mindful walking. See you then.

Thanks for practising with Salus.
