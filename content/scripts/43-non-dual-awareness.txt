NON-DUAL AWARENESS
Duration: 30 minutes
Style: Warm, grounded male narrator

---

Welcome to Salus.

This session is for experienced practitioners. We're going to explore non-dual awareness — the recognition that awareness itself has no centre, no edges, and no separation between the one who is aware and what is being experienced.

If that sounds abstract or intellectual, don't worry. This isn't a philosophy lecture. It's a guided exploration — a series of pointers, followed by silence. I'll point you in a direction, and your own direct experience will do the rest. There's very little to do here, and a lot to notice.

A word about the structure: the first portion of this session involves inquiry — questions and observations designed to shift your perspective. Then there will be extended periods of silence with very minimal guidance. That's intentional. Too many words obstruct what we're pointing toward. The silence isn't filler. It is the practice.

...

Sit comfortably. Spine upright but easy. Close your eyes.

...

Take a breath. Let your body settle.

...

...

Let's start with something simple, something you can verify right now.

Notice that you are aware.

Right now, in this moment, you know that you're sitting here. You know you're hearing my voice. You know there are sensations in your body — pressure, warmth, the feeling of clothes on your skin. You know there are sounds, maybe distant, maybe close. You know there are thoughts — perhaps anticipation about what this practice will be like, perhaps scepticism, perhaps curiosity.

You know all of this. How? Because there is awareness. Something is knowing all of this, right now.

...

...

Usually, we think of awareness as something we do. "I am aware of the room." There's a subject — me, the one in here — and objects — the room, the sounds, the sensations, out there. Subject and object. Seer and seen. Knower and known. A clear division.

For the next thirty minutes, I'd like to invite you to question that division. Not intellectually — not as a philosophical argument — but experientially. We're going to look directly at experience and see whether the division between subject and object actually holds up under examination.

...

...

...

Let's begin.

Notice a sound. Any sound in your environment. It might be a hum, traffic, birdsong, the settling of a building, the sound of your own breathing. Just pick one sound and listen.

...

...

Now, notice where the sound happens. We normally say the sound is "out there" — a car going past, a bird outside the window. But is that your actual experience? In your direct, immediate experience, is the sound separate from the hearing of it?

Where does the hearing happen? In your ears? In your brain? In awareness?

Can you find a boundary — a line — between the sound and the knowing of the sound?

...

...

...

Look carefully. Don't answer from theory or from what seems logical. Look at the raw experience itself. Sound arising. Knowing of sound. Are these two things, or one?

...

...

...

...

Now, notice a body sensation. Any sensation — maybe the feeling of your hands resting on your legs, maybe the pressure of your body on the chair. Just feel it.

...

...

Now, where does this sensation take place? We'd normally say it happens "in the body." But look more closely. In your actual experience — not in the model of the world you carry in your head, but in the raw, immediate experience of this moment — can you find a boundary between you and the sensation?

Is there a "you" here, and then separately a "sensation" there? Or is there just... experiencing? Just knowing? A single, seamless field in which sensation appears?

...

...

...

...

Don't rush to answer. Let the question sit. Let it work on you.

...

...

...

Now, notice a thought. Wait for one to come. It won't be long.

...

...

When a thought appears — a word, an image, a bit of inner commentary — notice it. And then ask: who is aware of this thought?

Is there a "me" that is separate from the knowing of the thought? Or is there just the thought, arising in awareness, and the knowing of it — with no gap between them?

...

...

...

...

This is the central inquiry. We're looking for the self — the one at the centre of experience — and finding... what? When you look for the looker, what do you find?

...

Turn attention around. Instead of looking at objects in awareness — sounds, sensations, thoughts — point attention back at itself. Look for the source of attention. Look for the one who is aware.

...

...

...

...

What do you find?

...

...

Most people, when they genuinely look, find nothing they can locate. Not a blankness or an emptiness — but the absence of a findable thing. There's awareness — vivid, present, undeniable — but no entity at the centre of it. No little person behind the eyes. No control room. No fixed point that you can say, "That's me. I'm here."

...

...

If you found something — a sense of "me-ness," a feeling of presence, an image of yourself — that's fine. But notice: that sensation, that image, that feeling — it itself is appearing in awareness. It's another experience, another object. And who is aware of it?

You can chase this back endlessly, and you'll never land on a final experiencer. Because awareness isn't a thing among things. It doesn't have a location. It doesn't have edges. It's more like the space in which everything appears — boundless, dimensionless, and utterly intimate.

...

...

...

...

...

Now, I want to introduce one more pointer before the silence.

Consider the possibility that you are not in the world. The world is in you.

Every experience you have — every sight, every sound, every sensation, every thought, every person, every place — appears in awareness. Your awareness. And that awareness has no boundary you can find. No inside and outside. No here and there.

What if the division between inner and outer is a habit of mind, not a feature of reality? What if there is just one seamless field of experiencing, and the sense of being a separate self looking out at a separate world is just a very compelling, very persistent thought?

...

...

You don't have to believe this. Just look. Just check.

...

...

...

...

...

Now, I'm going to step back. For the next several minutes, I'm going to say almost nothing. Just rest.

Don't try to do anything. Don't try to maintain a state. Don't try to "be non-dual" — that would just be another effort, another doing, another self trying to become something.

Just let everything be exactly as it is. Sounds arising and fading. Sensations appearing and dissolving. Thoughts coming and going. And all of it happening in this open, edgeless space that you cannot find the centre of.

You don't need to push anything away. You don't need to hold onto anything. Just let experience unfold, and notice that it's already being known, effortlessly, without your doing anything at all.

If you notice you've been caught in thought — identified with a narrative, lost in a daydream — that's fine. That's perfect, actually. Because the moment you notice is the moment awareness has already recognised itself. You don't need to do anything extra. The noticing is the freedom. Just see that you wandered, and notice that the open space of awareness was never disturbed by the wandering. It was there the whole time. It's there now.

...

Notice: has awareness itself changed at any point during this session? Thoughts have changed. Sensations have changed. Moods have come and gone. Sounds have arisen and faded. But the aware space in which all of that appeared — has it been altered? Disturbed? Diminished? Enhanced?

Look for yourself. Check your direct experience.

There is a way of resting where you're not doing meditation. You're not practising anything. You're not trying to achieve or maintain anything. There's just being. Not being something or someone. Just being. Awareness, open and undivided, without centre or circumference, with everything arising freely within it and dissolving freely within it.

If that's happening right now, don't move. Don't adjust. Don't congratulate yourself. Just stay.

If it's not — if there's effort, or confusion, or frustration — that's fine too. Let that be. Let even the struggle exist in awareness. It's not a problem. Awareness holds it all.

Gently, I'll bring a few more words in now.

...

...

What you may have glimpsed or touched or settled into over these minutes — that spacious, open quality of undivided being — this isn't something exotic. It isn't far away. It isn't reserved for monks or mystics. It's the most intimate, most ordinary thing there is. It's what you actually are, beneath all the stories, the identities, the mental noise, the sense of being a separate someone navigating a separate world.

You don't have to generate this awareness. You can't manufacture it. And you can't lose it. You can only overlook it — the way you overlook the screen while watching a movie. The screen is always there. It doesn't come and go with the images. And when you notice it, nothing about the movie changes. You just see what was always present.

...

...

...

...

The more you rest here — the more you simply notice what is already the case — the more transparent the sense of separation becomes. Not through effort, but through recognition.

...

...

...

Now, let's gently return to the conventional world. Not because we're leaving something behind — the conventional world arises within this same awareness. We're just re-engaging with the forms.

Feel your body. The weight of it. The shape of it. The warmth and pressure and aliveness.

...

...

Hear the sounds around you. Let them come to you without grasping at them.

...

...

Notice the room. The space you're in.

...

Take a slightly deeper breath.

...

And exhale.

...

...

Open your eyes slowly. Let visual experience flood in.

And notice: is awareness any different with the eyes open? Or is it the same open, edgeless space — now including colour, shape, depth, and light?

...

...

...

Everything you experience today — every conversation, every task, every moment of beauty or difficulty or boredom — will appear in this same awareness. You don't have to leave it to live your life. You don't have to close your eyes to find it. It is the space in which your life happens. It is what your life is made of.

...

...

Thanks for practising with Salus. There is nowhere else to go.
