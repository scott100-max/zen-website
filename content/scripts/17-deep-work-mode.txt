This is Deep Work Mode. Five minutes to clear your head, lock in, and get to work. No fluff, no long wind-up. Let's get you focused.

Sit up straight. Feet on the floor. Close your eyes.

...

First breath. In through the nose, deep and slow.

...

Out through the mouth. Let everything go. The last conversation, the last notification, the last thing you were thinking about. Gone.

...

Second breath. In. Feel your chest expand.

...

Out. Feel your shoulders drop away from your ears. Let your jaw unclench.

...

Third breath. The anchor breath. Breathe in like you're drawing a line under everything that came before this moment.

...

And breathe out like you're stepping through a doorway into a clean, quiet room. That room is your focus.

...

...

Good. You're here now. Just you and the work ahead.

I want you to take a moment and clear the mental slate. Whatever's been bouncing around in your head, you're going to let it go for now. Think of your mind like a whiteboard that's been scribbled on all day. We're wiping it clean. Not erasing anything permanently. Just clearing the surface so you have space to think.

...

...

See that blank space. Feel how much room there is when you're not trying to hold onto fifteen things at once.

...

Now, think about what you're about to work on. Get specific. Not the project in general. The actual task. The thing you're going to do in the next thirty, sixty, ninety minutes. Define it in one sentence.

...

...

Got it? Good. That's the only thing that matters right now. Everything else can wait. Emails can wait. Messages can wait. That thing you just remembered you need to do later can wait. Write it down if you need to, then let it go.

...

Now let's set your breathing for the session ahead. Nice and steady. In through the nose for four. Out for four. Even and balanced. This keeps your brain in an optimal state for cognitive work. Not too relaxed, not too activated. Right in the productive middle.

Breathe in, two, three, four.

...

Out, two, three, four.

...

In, two, three, four.

...

Out, two, three, four.

...

...

Let that rhythm settle into the background. You won't need to think about it. Your body will carry it forward.

...

One final thing. I want you to make a quick commitment to yourself. Say this silently: "For the next block of time, I'm fully in. No distractions. No switching. One thing, done well."

...

...

That's a promise to yourself. It matters. When the urge to check something comes up, and it will, remember that promise. Take one breath and get back to work. The urge passes faster than you think.

...

Alright. Three, two, one.

Open your eyes.

...

You're clear. You're focused. You know exactly what to do.

Go.

Thanks for practising with Salus.
