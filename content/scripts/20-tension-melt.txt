Welcome to Salus.

Get yourself comfortable. Sitting or lying down — either works. Just make sure you're somewhere you can be still for a while.

...

Let your eyes close if that feels OK. If not, just soften your gaze and look down.

...

Take a slow breath in through your nose.

...

And out through your mouth. Let that exhale take its time.

...

Again. In.

...

And out.

...

One more. Breathe in deeply.

...

And release.

...

Good. Now I want you to picture something. Imagine that all the tension in your body — every tight spot, every knot, every place that's been holding on — is ice. Small patches of ice sitting inside your muscles, your joints, the soft tissue around your bones. It's been there so long you've stopped noticing it. But it's there.

...

And what we're going to do, slowly and gently, is melt it.

...

Not with force. Not by chipping away at it. Just with warmth. Steady, patient warmth. The kind that doesn't rush.

...

Let's start with your jaw. This is one of the most common places we carry tension, and most of us don't even realise we're clenching.

...

Notice your jaw right now. Is it tight? Are your teeth pressed together? Are the muscles along the sides of your face working even though they don't need to be?

...

Now imagine a gentle warmth arriving there. Like sunlight falling across your face on a cool morning. It's not harsh. It's not hot. It's just warm enough to soften things.

...

Feel it reach the ice in your jaw. Feel the edges start to blur. The tension starts to lose its shape.

...

...

Slowly, it melts. You might notice your jaw dropping slightly. Your teeth parting. The muscles along your cheeks and temples going slack. Let that happen.

...

...

That meltwater — just imagine it draining away. Dissolving into nothing. Gone.

...

...

Now move to your shoulders. Another place that collects tension like it's being stored for winter.

...

Notice them. Are they crept up towards your ears? Is there a tightness across the top? Into the base of your neck?

...

Bring that same warmth here. Imagine it settling over your shoulders like a warm cloth draped across them. Heavy and gentle.

...

The ice starts to soften. The hard edges round off. What was rigid starts to give way.

...

...

Let your shoulders drop. Feel them move down as the tension melts. There's no effort here. Gravity does the work. The warmth does the work. You just have to allow it.

...

...

Feel the meltwater trickle down through your arms. Light and cool. And then it's gone.

...

...

Take a breath here. In through the nose.

...

Out through the mouth.

...

Now your neck. The back of your neck, specifically. If you've been hunching over a desk, a phone, a steering wheel — it's there. That thick band of tension running from the base of your skull down to your shoulders.

...

Let the warmth reach it. Slowly. Carefully. This area can be stubborn, so we're not going to force anything. We're just going to be patient.

...

...

Feel the ice begin to crack. Not painfully — gently. Like ice on a lake in spring. It fissures. It softens. The pieces get smaller.

...

...

And they melt. Your neck lengthens. The muscles release. Your head feels like it's floating just slightly — supported but not gripped.

...

...

Now let's move to your back. Upper back first. Between the shoulder blades. There's often a stubborn knot of tension here, right in the centre.

...

Find it. Notice it. Don't fight it — just acknowledge that it's there.

...

Now bring the warmth. Imagine it radiating outward from your spine. A slow, steady heat that seeps into those tight spots.

...

...

The ice softens. Your upper back starts to open. You might feel your chest expand slightly as the front of your body responds to the release in the back.

...

...

Let the warmth move down. Through your mid-back. Into your lower back. This is another big one. The lower back carries the weight of everything — physically, and sometimes emotionally too.

...

...

Let the warmth gather here. Let it pool in the small of your back. Warm and heavy and deeply comforting.

...

The ice melts slowly. You feel your lower back softening into whatever's supporting you. The arch reduces. The muscles let go of their grip.

...

...

...

Take a breath. A slow one.

...

And let it go.

...

Now your hands. Open them if they're closed. Spread your fingers gently and then let them relax.

...

There's tension in your hands that you've been carrying all day. Every grip, every tap, every time you clenched without thinking. It's all stored here.

...

Bring the warmth into your palms. Imagine holding something warm — a mug, a stone from the beach, someone's hand. Feel the heat move into the centre of your palms and then spread outward.

...

...

Through your fingers. Through your wrists. The ice dissolves. Your hands become soft. Loose. Warm.

...

...

Let them rest. Completely open. Completely easy.

...

...

Now take a moment to scan your whole body. Start at the top of your head and slowly move your attention downward. Your forehead. Your eyes. Your jaw — already softer. Your neck. Your shoulders. Your arms. Your chest. Your stomach. Your lower back. Your hips. Your legs. Your feet.

...

...

...

Anywhere you find tension — any last stubborn patch of ice — send warmth there. You know how to do it now. Just let the heat find it. Let it soften. Let it melt.

...

...

...

Your body is warmer now. Softer. Lighter. The ice is gone — or most of it. And what's left will keep melting in its own time. You've started the process. Your body will finish it.

...

...

Stay here for another moment. Just rest in this feeling. There's nowhere to be. Nothing to do. Just this warmth. This quiet. This body that's finally been given permission to let go.

...

...

...

When you're ready, start to bring some gentle movement back. Fingers and toes first. A small stretch if it feels right.

...

Take a deep breath. In.

...

And out.

...

Let your eyes open when they're ready. No rush. Let the world come back gently.

...

You've done something good here. Carry that warmth with you.

This has been Salus. Be well.
