This is a quick reset. Five minutes. That's all you need right now, and that's all we're going to take. Let's make them count.

...

Wherever you are — at your desk, in your car, standing in a hallway — just pause. You don't need to lie down. You don't need a quiet room. You just need to stop moving for a moment.

...

Let's start with three breaths. Three proper ones. Here's the first.

Breathe in slowly through your nose. Fill your lungs. Feel your chest expand. Feel your belly push out.

...

And breathe out through your mouth. Slowly. All the way. Push the last bit of air out.

...

Second breath. In. Big and slow.

...

And out. Let your shoulders drop on this one. Feel them fall.

...

Third breath. In. This one's the deepest.

...

And out. Let everything go. Every bit of tension you can find on that exhale — let it leave with the air.

...

...

Good. Now let's do a quick body check. You don't need to close your eyes for this. Just turn your attention inward for a moment.

Your jaw — is it clenched? Let it relax. Let there be a gap between your teeth.

...

Your shoulders — are they up near your ears? Drop them. Let them settle.

...

Your hands — are they gripping anything? Fists? A phone? Let them open. Let them soften.

...

Your stomach — is it tight? Let it go. Let it be easy.

...

...

Now here's the release. I want you to imagine that all the stress you've accumulated — everything from the morning, from the last meeting, from the last conversation, from whatever's been building — imagine it as a physical weight sitting on your shoulders.

...

Feel how heavy it is.

...

And now imagine shrugging it off. Literally. Roll your shoulders back if you can. And as you do, that weight slides off and hits the floor. You don't need to carry it right now. It'll be there later if you really want to pick it back up. But for now, it's on the ground.

...

...

Take one more breath. In.

...

And out.

...

Now recentre. You're here. In this moment. Not in the last hour, not in the next one. Right here.

...

Feel your feet on the ground. Feel the surface beneath you. Feel the air around you. You're alive, you're breathing, and you've just given yourself five minutes of care. That's not small. That's a choice. A good one.

...

...

When you're ready, take that last breath — a good deep one — and step back into whatever comes next. You've got this. You've always got this.

...

This has been Salus. Go well.
