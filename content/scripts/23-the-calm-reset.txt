Whatever is happening right now, you found your way here. That is enough.
...
This is five minutes. Just five. And they are yours.
...
You do not need to lie down. You do not need a quiet room. Just stop for a moment.
...
We are going to start with something your body already knows how to do. Two short breaths in through your nose, then one long breath out through your mouth.
...
Here is the first one. Breathe in through your nose. And before you let it out, sip in a little more air on top.
[SILENCE: 4]
And let it all pour out through your mouth. Slowly. All of it.
...
Good. Again. Two breaths in through your nose. A little more on top.
[SILENCE: 4]
And release. Long and slow out through your mouth.
...
One more time. In through your nose. Sip in a little extra.
[SILENCE: 4]
And let everything go.
...
...
You might already feel something shifting. That is your nervous system beginning to settle.
...
Now let your attention land on your body. Your jaw. Is it clenched? Let it soften. Let there be a gap between your teeth.
...
Your shoulders. Are they up near your ears? Drop them.
...
Your hands. If they are gripping anything, let them open.
...
Your stomach. Is it tight? See if you can let it go.
...
...
Now feel your feet on the ground. Feel the weight of your body being held by whatever is beneath you.
...
You are here. Not in the last hour. Not in the next one. Right here.
...
...
Take one more breath. Deep in through your nose.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out through your mouth. Slow and complete.
...
You have just given yourself five minutes. That is not small. That is a choice you made for yourself.
...
Whenever you need this, it is here. A few sighs, a few breaths, and you can find your way back.
...
When you are ready, step back into whatever comes next.
...
Thank you for practicing with Salus.
...
Sleep, relax, restore.
