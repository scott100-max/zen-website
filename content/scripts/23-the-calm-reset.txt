This is a quick reset. Five minutes. Let's make them count.
...
Wherever you are, just pause. You do not need to lie down or close your eyes. Just stop moving for a moment.
...
...
Three breaths. Here is the first. In through your nose, letting your chest open wide.
[SILENCE: 5]
And out through your mouth. Slowly. Push the last bit of air out.
...
Second breath. In through your nose. Big and slow.
[SILENCE: 5]
And out. Let your shoulders drop as the air leaves. Notice how far they fall.
...
Third breath. This one is the widest. In through your nose.
[SILENCE: 5]
And out. Let every bit of tension leave with that exhale. All of it.
...
......
Good. Quick body check. Your jaw, is it clenched? Let it soften. Let there remain a small gap between your teeth.
...
Your shoulders. Are they up near your ears? Drop them. Let them rest where they belong.
...
Your hands. Are they gripping anything? A phone, a steering wheel, your own fist? Let them open and soften.
...
Your stomach. Is it tight? Loosen it on the next exhale and let it go.
...
......
Now imagine all the stress you have accumulated today as a physical weight sitting across your shoulders. Really register how heavy it is.
...
...
And imagine shrugging it off. Roll your shoulders back, and that weight slides off and lands on the floor. You do not need to carry it right now. It will wait if you want it later. But right now, it is on the ground.
...
......
One more breath. In through your nose, wide and slow.
[SILENCE: 5]
And out. You are here. Not in the last hour, not in the next. Right here.
...
......
Five minutes of care. That is not small. That is a choice, and a good one.
...
Step back into whatever comes next when you are ready. You have got this.
...
Thank you for practising with Salus. Go well, and go gently.
