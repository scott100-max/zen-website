Expected-Repetitions: what does the evidence actually say

Welcome to Rewriting the Rule.
...
This is the third exercise in the core beliefs series. If you have already completed The Tabletop and The Downward Arrow, you will have identified a core belief. A deep sentence about yourself that has been running quietly in the background of your life for a long time.
...
Today we are going to do something with it. Not argue with it. Not replace it with something artificially positive. We are going to examine whether it deserves to be the rule you live by, and if it does not, we are going to write a better one.
......
Find a comfortable position. Let your body arrive where it is.
...
Breathe in slowly through your nose.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out through your mouth. Let your shoulders release a fraction.
...
One more. In.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out. Good. Let your breathing settle into whatever rhythm it wants.
......
Bring to mind the core belief you have been working with. The deep one. The one that starts with I am, or I will always, or I do not deserve. If you are not sure what yours is, take a moment and let it surface. You will know it by the way it tightens your body when you think it.
...
[SILENCE: 15]
Place that sentence in front of you. Not inside you. In front of you. On a table, on a wall, wherever your mind puts it. You are looking at it, not living inside it.
......
Now. Before we change anything, I want to acknowledge something important. This belief has been with you for a long time. It did not arrive randomly. At some point, it served a purpose.
...
Maybe it protected you from disappointment by keeping your expectations low. Maybe it kept you safe by making you hypervigilant. Maybe believing the worst about yourself meant you were never caught off guard.
...
That is not weakness. That is a young mind doing its best with limited information. The belief was an adaptation. But adaptations that helped you survive childhood are not always the ones that help you thrive as an adult.
......
So let us test it. Not with feelings. With evidence.
...
First question. If you presented this belief in a courtroom, as a statement of fact, what specific evidence would you submit to support it?
...
Not interpretations. Not feelings. Not things you suspect other people think. Actual, observable evidence.
...
[SILENCE: 30]
How much did you find? Some people find a handful of examples. Some find less than they expected. Some realise that the evidence is mostly one or two painful experiences that have been generalised into a life sentence.
......
Now the second question. What evidence exists that contradicts this belief? Think broadly. Relationships where this belief did not apply. Achievements that should not have been possible if the belief were true. Moments of connection, competence, or care that the belief cannot explain.
...
[SILENCE: 30]
Most people find more contradictory evidence than supporting evidence. This is almost always the case. The belief has survived not because the evidence supports it, but because it was never properly examined.
......
Third question, and this one requires honesty. How has holding this belief shaped your behaviour?
...
If you believe you are not good enough, do you overwork? Avoid challenges? Settle for less than you want? If you believe you are unlovable, do you push people away? Test relationships? Withdraw before you can be rejected?
...
Core beliefs do not just describe your life. They shape it. They create the very patterns that seem to confirm them. This is the most important thing to understand. The belief manufactures its own evidence.
...
[SILENCE: 15]
Sit with that for a moment. Some of what you thought was proof may actually be a consequence of the belief itself.
......
Now we write the new rule. Not a fantasy. Not an affirmation designed to sound good. Something that accounts for all the evidence, good and bad, and arrives at a more accurate conclusion.
...
The old rule is extreme. It uses words like always, never, everyone, nothing. I will always fail. Nobody could love me. I am never enough.
...
The new rule is specific and honest. It accounts for difficulty without turning difficulty into identity.
...
For example. I struggle with confidence sometimes, but I have handled difficult things before and I can handle them again. That is not inspirational. It is accurate. And accuracy is more powerful than inspiration because you can actually believe it.
...
Take a moment now. Using whatever core belief you brought to this session, see if you can write a more balanced version. Not the opposite. Not the positive spin. The honest version that includes all the evidence.
...
[SILENCE: 30]
Read your new sentence back to yourself. Notice how it lands in your body compared to the old one. It may not feel comfortable yet. That is fine. Comfort with a new belief takes time. What matters is whether it is more accurate.
......
The old belief was installed once. It arrived through repetition, through emotion, through other people's words landing in the right place at the right time. The new belief needs the same things to take root. Not a single moment of insight. Repeated exposure.
...
This is what makes core belief work different from other CBT exercises. You cannot restructure a core belief in one session. But you can begin the process. And every time you notice the old belief operating, every time you catch it shaping your decisions, you weaken it a little more. And every time you deliberately recall the evidence that contradicts it, you strengthen the new one.
......
There is one more thing I want you to do before we finish. Think of one action you could take in the next week that would be consistent with the new belief rather than the old one.
...
Something small. If the old belief says you are not enough, the action might be applying for something you would normally talk yourself out of. If the old belief says you are unlovable, the action might be letting someone in a little closer than usual.
...
You do not need to announce it or make it dramatic. Just one small thing that the old belief would have prevented.
...
[SILENCE: 15]
Hold that action in your mind. It is not a test. It is practice. Every time you act from the new belief, even in a small way, you add a leg to a new table.
......
Take a breath in. Slow and wide.
[SILENCE: 4]
And let it go.
...
Let the sentences dissolve. The old one and the new one. They will both be there when you need them. But for now, let the exercise settle.
...
Bring your attention back to the room. Your body. The surface beneath you. The sounds around you. Whatever is here, right now.
...
Open your eyes whenever you are ready.
......
Core beliefs change slowly. They do not collapse in a single session. They erode, the way water wears stone. Each time you examine the evidence, each time you choose the more accurate sentence, each time you take a small action that contradicts the old rule, you are reshaping something that felt permanent.
...
It was never permanent. It was just unexamined.
...
Thank you for practising with Salus.
