The harbour is quiet now, and the light is fading.
...
The last of the evening light has drained from the sky, leaving behind a deep blue that is almost violet at the horizon. The boats around you creak softly in the water, their hulls knocking against each other with a lazy, irregular rhythm.
...
You are standing on the deck of a small wooden sailing boat. It is old but well kept. The planks beneath your feet are smooth from years of salt and weather. The rigging hums faintly in a breeze so light you can barely notice it on your skin.
...
The harbour smells of salt and rope and something sweet from the bakery on the quayside that closed an hour ago. A few lights glow in the windows of the buildings along the waterfront, but most have gone dark. The town has turned in for the night.
......
You untie the mooring line and coil it neatly on the deck. The boat drifts backwards, almost imperceptibly, away from the stone wall of the harbour. You let it go at its own pace. There is no hurry tonight.
...
The sail catches a breath of wind and fills with a soft, satisfying sound, like a sheet being shaken out over a bed. The boat turns gently and begins to move forward, the water parting around the bow with a quiet hiss.
......
The harbour mouth is wide and calm. As you pass through it, the sheltered water gives way to the open ocean. The difference is subtle at first, a deeper swell beneath the hull, a wider sky above you, the lights of the town growing smaller behind you.
...
You do not look back. There is nothing to attend to on the shore tonight. Whatever you left behind can wait. Out here, the only thing that matters is the water, the wind, and the gentle forward motion of the boat.
......
The ocean at night is not the ocean you see during the day. The waves are invisible, but you can hear them. A low, steady murmur that surrounds you on every side, punctuated by the occasional splash of water against the hull.
...
Above you, the sky has opened into something enormous. Without the glow of the town, the stars have appeared in their thousands. Not the dozen bright ones you might see from a city window, but a vast field of light stretching from horizon to horizon.
...
The boat moves through this darkness with a rhythm that matches your breathing. Rise and fall. Rise and fall.
...
The motion is so gentle and so constant that your body begins to absorb it, swaying slightly with each swell without any effort on your part.
......
You sit down on the deck, your back resting against the cabin wall. The wood is still faintly warm from the afternoon sun. The tiller is lashed in position. The sail is set. The boat knows where it is going.
...
From out here, the world is remarkably simple. There is water beneath you, air around you, and sky above you. No walls, no screens, no clocks, no tasks. Just the boat and the ocean and the long, unhurried night ahead.
......
A phosphorescent glow appears in the water alongside the hull. Tiny organisms lit from within, disturbed by the passage of the boat, leaving a trail of pale blue-green light in your wake.
...
It pulses and shifts with each wave, as though the ocean itself is breathing.
...
You trail your hand over the side of the boat and the glow intensifies around your fingers. The water is cool but not cold. It runs between your fingers and falls back into the sea, taking the last of any tension in your hand with it.
......
In the distance, you can make out the dark outline of an island. It rises from the water like the back of a sleeping animal. No lights, no roads, no sound from its direction. Just the shape of it, solid and quiet against the stars.
...
The wind carries a faint scent of pine and wild herbs from the island's slopes. The breeze is warm. It moves across your face and through your hair and you let your eyes close for a moment to notice it more clearly.
......
The boat has found a natural channel between the island and a smaller outcrop of rock. The water here is calmer, sheltered from the open swell.
...
The motion of the hull settles into something even softer, barely perceptible, like being rocked in a hammock strung between two very old trees.
...
You can hear the waves arriving gently against the island's shore. A rhythmic, unhurried sound that repeats and repeats without ever being exactly the same twice.
...
Each wave arrives, pauses, and withdraws. The next one follows. And the next. And the next.
......
The sail has gone slack in the shelter of the island. The boat drifts, turning slowly in a lazy circle. There is nothing to correct and no reason to adjust anything.
...
The anchor is right there if you want it, but there is no need. The current will hold you here.
...
Overhead, a shooting star crosses the sky in a thin line of white and is gone before you can fully register it. You smile. There is no one to tell and nothing to wish for. You are already exactly where you want to be.
......
Your eyelids are heavy now. The deck beneath you is warm and solid. The motion of the boat is so slight and so rhythmic that your body has stopped distinguishing between the swell of the water and the rhythm of your own breathing.
...
They have merged into one slow, steady, quiet movement.
...
Let the sound of the water hold you. The quiet lapping against the hull, the distant murmur of waves on the shore, the creak of the rigging as the boat turns. These sounds will continue all night, whether you are listening or not.
......
The stars are so bright out here. But your eyes are too heavy to watch them now. That is fine. They will be there in the morning, hidden behind the blue of the sky, exactly where you left them.
...
The boat drifts. The water holds it. The night holds everything.
......
Let the water carry you from here. Goodnight from Salus.
