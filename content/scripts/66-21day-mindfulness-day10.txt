Finish this sentence in your mind.

...

I am the kind of person who. Take a moment and let whatever comes up arrive without editing it.

...

...

[SILENCE: 15]

...

Whatever you just said to yourself, whether it was kind or harsh, accurate or outdated, that is a story. And you carry hundreds of them. Stories about who you are, what you are good at, what you are not, what you deserve, and what you do not.

...

...

Today you are going to examine those stories. Not to rewrite them, not yet, but to see them for what they are. Constructions. Narratives assembled from memory, repetition, and other people's opinions. Some of them are true. Some of them were true once. And some of them were never true at all.

...

...

...

This work draws from a field called narrative psychology, pioneered by Dan McAdams and others. The core insight is powerful. The story you tell about yourself shapes how you live. Change the story, and the life changes with it.

...

...

Close your eyes whenever you are ready, and take a few breaths to arrive.

...

...

...

We are going to start with the obvious stories. The ones that live at the surface. Complete each of the sentences I give you silently, and notice what comes up without judging it.

...

I am good at. Take a moment and let the answer arrive on its own.

...

[SILENCE: 10]

...

I am not very good at. Again, let whatever comes up be there.

...

[SILENCE: 10]

...

...

People would describe me as. Take your time with this one.

...

[SILENCE: 10]

...

...

Those are surface stories. Most people can access them quickly. But there are deeper stories underneath, the ones that run quietly in the background, shaping your decisions without ever being examined.

...

...

...

Try this one. I do not deserve. Let it sit for a moment and see if anything rises.

...

[SILENCE: 15]

...

...

And this one. If people really knew me, they would. Let the answer arrive on its own.

...

[SILENCE: 15]

...

...

Whatever came up for you there, notice one thing. Those sentences completed themselves. You did not have to think hard. The story was already there, ready and rehearsed, waiting for someone to ask.

...

That is how deep these narratives go. They run on autopilot, below the level of conscious thought, shaping how you see yourself every moment of every day.

...

...

...

Now here is the important question, and I want you to sit with it rather than answering it quickly. Where did that story come from? Who told it to you first? Was it a parent, a teacher, a friend, a stranger? Was it something that happened once and became a permanent conclusion? Or was it something you heard so many times you stopped questioning it?

...

...

Pick one of the stories that came up, whichever one had the most energy behind it, and trace it back. Not to analyse it, but to notice that it has an origin. It started somewhere. It was not always there.

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

...

Here is the skill for today. When you notice a story about yourself running, you can do three things.

...

First, name it. That is a story. Not a fact, not a truth, but a narrative that I have been carrying.

...

Second, trace it. Where did it come from? How long have I been telling it to myself?

...

...

And third, test it. Is this still true? Was it ever true? Would I say this about someone I cared about?

...

You do not have to throw any story away today. Some of your stories are accurate and useful. The skill is knowing which ones you chose and which ones chose you.

...

...

...

I am going to give you some extended quiet now. During this time, let your stories surface on their own. Each time one arrives, name it as a story, notice how it makes you hold yourself, and let it pass. You are the one who carries the stories. You are not the stories themselves.

[SILENCE: 120]

...

...

...

Gently begin to notice the room around you again. Let the stories settle back down. You can return to any of them later if you choose.

...

...

Open your eyes when you are ready, and take a moment to notice how you are carrying your body right now compared to when you started.

...

...

Your homework today is a writing exercise, and it takes five minutes. At some point, write down three statements that start with I am. Three things you believe about yourself. Then underneath each one, write where you first heard it. You do not have to do anything about what you find. Just notice.

...

...

Every story has a first chapter. And you can always begin a new one. See you tomorrow.
