Welcome back to Salus.

Day Three. You're halfway through the week now. The fact that you keep showing up is the practice working.

So far we've worked with the breath and the body. Today we're going to work with something trickier — thoughts.

...

Most people think mindfulness means stopping your thoughts. Emptying your mind. Having no thoughts at all.

That's not it. That's actually impossible.

Mindfulness isn't about stopping thoughts. It's about changing your relationship to them. Instead of being lost in your thoughts, you learn to observe them. Instead of believing every thought that arises, you see them for what they are — just thoughts.

...

Here's the insight that changes everything: you are not your thoughts.

Thoughts come and go. They arise on their own, without your permission. You didn't decide to have your last thought — it just appeared. And then another one came. And another.

Mindfulness helps you step back and watch this process. You become the observer of thoughts rather than being pushed around by them.

...

Let's explore this directly. Get comfortable. Sitting is good for today — alert but relaxed.

...

Close your eyes.

...

Take a few settling breaths. In through the nose.

...

Out through the mouth.

...

Let your breathing find its natural rhythm.

...

Now, instead of focusing on the breath, I want you to turn your attention to your mind. Just watch. See what thoughts arise.

Don't try to think about anything in particular. Don't try not to think. Just sit back and observe the mind. Like watching clouds pass across the sky.

...

...

...

What's there? Maybe a thought about this practice. A thought about later. A memory. A plan. A worry. A random image.

Just notice what comes.

...

...

...

When a thought appears, see if you can observe it without getting pulled into it. You might silently label it — "thinking" — and let it pass.

...

...

...

Notice the nature of thoughts. They appear. They linger for a moment. They dissolve. New ones come.

...

...

...

You don't have to chase any thought. You don't have to push any thought away. Just watch them come and go, like waves on a shore.

...

...

...

If you find yourself lost in a thought — carried away by a story or a plan or a worry — that's completely normal. The moment you realise you've been lost, you've woken up. Just return to observing.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Notice: there's a part of you that watches the thoughts. That awareness itself isn't thinking. It's just aware. That's what we're cultivating.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

See if you can rest in that awareness. The open space in which thoughts come and go. Not trying to create any particular experience. Just being aware.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Good.

...

Now, let's do something different. Think of a minor worry you have. Not your biggest fear — just something small that's been on your mind. A task you need to do, a conversation you're putting off, a low-level concern.

...

Hold that worry in your mind for a moment.

...

Now, notice — you're aware of the worry. The worry is an object in your awareness. You're bigger than it. You contain it; it doesn't contain you.

...

See if you can observe the worry without being the worry. It's just a thought pattern. Sensations in the body. Maybe a tightness somewhere. But it's not you. You're the one watching.

...

...

...

Let the worry dissolve. Let it go. It'll come back later if it needs to. For now, just open space.

...

...

...

Take a deeper breath in.

...

And exhale slowly.

...

Today's practice reveals something important: thoughts are not facts. They're not commands. They're just mental events that come and go. You can learn to take them less seriously without ignoring what's actually important.

...

For today's invitation: try to catch yourself lost in thought at least once. When you notice — ah, I was thinking — celebrate that moment. That's mindfulness in action.

...

Gently open your eyes when you're ready.

...

Day Three — done. Tomorrow we'll explore emotions. See you then.

Thanks for practising with Salus.
