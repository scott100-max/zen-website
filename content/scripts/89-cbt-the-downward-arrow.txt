Welcome to The Downward Arrow.
...
This is a core beliefs exercise. It uses one of the oldest and most reliable techniques in cognitive therapy. Simple in concept, surprisingly powerful in practice.
...
Most of the thoughts that bother us are surface-level. They are specific, situational, and loud. I am going to mess up this presentation. She did not reply because she is angry with me. I should not have said that.
...
But underneath every surface thought, if you follow it far enough, there is something deeper. A belief about who you are, not just what happened.
...
Today we are going to follow one thought all the way down.
......
Settle into wherever you are sitting. There is no special posture required.
...
Take a slow breath in.
[SILENCE: 4]
And release it gently. Let your jaw soften. Let your shoulders drop.
...
One more breath. In through the nose.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out. Good. Let your breathing settle.
......
The technique we are using today is called the downward arrow. It works by asking one question, again and again, each time moving one layer deeper.
...
The question is this. And what would that mean?
...
It sounds almost too simple. But watch what it does.
......
Begin by bringing to mind something that has been bothering you recently. A worry, a self-criticism, a situation that keeps replaying. Something specific. Not the worst thing in your life, just something that has weight.
...
[SILENCE: 15]
Hold that thought clearly. Now I want you to state it to yourself as a sentence. One clear sentence.
...
[SILENCE: 10]
Good. That is the surface. That is where most of us stay. We circle around this sentence, worry about it, argue with it, lose sleep over it. But we rarely go below it.
...
Today, we go below.
......
Take that sentence and ask yourself, gently. And if that were true, what would it mean about me?
...
Do not analyse it. Do not try to give the correct answer. Just let whatever comes up arrive naturally.
...
[SILENCE: 15]
Whatever surfaced, hold it. That is the second layer. It is probably a little more personal than the first. A little more uncomfortable. You have moved from what happened to what it says about you.
......
Now take that new sentence and ask the same question again. And if that were true, what would it mean?
...
[SILENCE: 15]
You may notice the sentences getting shorter. More direct. Closer to something that feels like a raw nerve. That is normal. That is the technique working.
......
One more time. Take whatever you are holding now, and ask once more. And what would that mean about me?
...
[SILENCE: 15]
Sit with whatever arrived. You are close to the core now, or perhaps you have reached it. You will know because the sentence will feel different. It will not be about a situation any more. It will be about you. And it will feel old. Like something you have known for a very long time, even if you have never said it out loud.
......
Common ones sound like this. I am not good enough. I am unlovable. I am a failure. I do not matter. I will always be alone.
...
These sentences are brutal. They are also ancient. Most of them were installed long before you had the tools to question them. And because they arrived early, they became invisible. They sank below the surface and started running things from underneath.
...
Every surface thought you have been worrying about is connected, by a chain of meaning, to something like this.
......
Now, I do not want you to fight this belief. Not yet. Fighting it gives it energy. What I want you to do is simply see it.
...
Imagine writing it on a piece of paper and placing it in front of you. There it is. The sentence that has been organising your anxiety, your self-doubt, your reactions, for years.
...
Take a breath.
...
[SILENCE: 10]
The fact that you can see it means you are no longer inside it. You have created distance. And distance is the beginning of freedom.
......
Here is something worth knowing. Core beliefs are not conclusions drawn from evidence. They are interpretations made under pressure, usually when you were young, usually when you did not have the full picture.
...
A child who is criticised constantly does not think, my parent is overwhelmed and taking it out on me. They think, I am the problem. That is not logic. It is survival. And it becomes a belief that lasts decades.
...
You are no longer that child. But the belief is still running.
......
Now I want you to do something gentle with this belief. Not destroy it. Just test it.
...
Ask yourself this. Is this always true? In every situation? With every person?
...
[SILENCE: 10]
Think of one moment, just one, where this belief was contradicted. A time someone showed you the opposite. A time you surprised yourself.
...
[SILENCE: 20]
That moment exists. It may feel small next to the weight of the belief. But it is real. And it is evidence that the belief is not the complete truth.
......
You do not need to resolve this today. The downward arrow is a tool for seeing, not for fixing. Seeing clearly is the first step. Everything else follows from that.
...
What you have done today is trace the wiring. You started with a surface worry and followed it to its source. Now you know what is underneath. And something that has been seen cannot go back to being invisible.
......
Take a slow breath in.
[SILENCE: 4]
And release it. Let the paper with the sentence dissolve. You can return to it any time you need to. But for now, let it go.
...
Bring your attention back to the room around you. Your hands. Your feet. The sounds in the background.
...
Open your eyes whenever you are ready.
......
The downward arrow is portable. You can use it anywhere. Next time a thought bothers you, ask the question. And what would that mean? Follow the chain. See where it leads.
...
Most surface worries, when you trace them far enough, lead to the same two or three beliefs. Once you know which ones are yours, they lose a great deal of their power. Not because you argued with them. Because you saw them.
...
Thank you for practising with Salus.
