Welcome back to Salus.

Day Five. Today we're doing something different. We're getting off the cushion and onto our feet. This is walking meditation.

...

A lot of people think meditation means sitting still with your eyes closed. But mindfulness can be practised in any posture, during any activity. And walking is one of the best ways to discover this.

Walking meditation bridges the gap between formal practice and daily life. It shows you that mindfulness isn't something you do for ten minutes and then forget about. It's available in every moment, every step.

...

For this practice, you'll need a space where you can walk slowly for about twenty paces. A hallway works. A garden path. Even just back and forth across a room. You don't need much space.

If you can't walk, you can adapt this to any repetitive movement — even moving your hands slowly in your lap.

...

So find your walking space. Stand at one end.

...

Before we move, let's arrive. Stand still for a moment. Feel your feet on the ground. Feel the weight of your body pressing down through your soles.

...

Notice your posture. Let your shoulders relax. Let your arms hang naturally at your sides.

...

Take a breath. Feel yourself standing here, connected to the earth.

...

...

Now, very slowly, begin to walk. Much slower than normal. Slow enough that you can feel every part of each step.

...

Feel your weight shift to one foot.

...

Feel the other heel lift off the ground.

...

Feel the foot move through the air.

...

Feel it place down — heel, then sole, then toes.

...

Feel your weight shift onto that foot.

...

...

Continue walking. One slow step at a time. Feel the lifting.

...

The moving.

...

The placing.

...

The shifting.

...

...

...

Your mind will wander. You'll suddenly find yourself thinking about something else, maybe walking faster without noticing. When that happens, simply stop. Stand still. Reconnect with your feet on the ground. Then begin again.

...

...

...

...

Keep walking. Lifting.

...

Moving.

...

Placing.

...

Shifting.

...

...

...

Notice how complex walking actually is. We do it every day without thinking. But there's so much happening — balance, coordination, muscles contracting and releasing, weight transferring.

...

...

...

When you reach the end of your walking space, stop. Stand still for a moment.

...

Slowly, mindfully, turn around. Feel every part of the turn.

...

Stand facing the other direction. Feel your feet.

...

Begin walking again. Slow, deliberate steps.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Lifting.

...

Moving.

...

Placing.

...

Each step is complete in itself. You're not trying to get anywhere. You're just walking to walk.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

If you want, you can synchronise with your breath. Perhaps two steps on the inhale, two steps on the exhale. But this is optional. The main practice is just feeling each step.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Now, let yourself gradually return to a more natural pace. Still mindful, but not quite so slow. Feel how you can maintain awareness even as you speed up slightly.

...

...

...

Come to a stop. Stand still.

...

Feel your feet on the ground. Feel your body standing here. Feel the breath moving in and out.

...

...

Take a deeper breath in.

...

And exhale.

...

Walking meditation is a practice you can do anytime, anywhere. Walking to your car. Walking down the hallway at work. Walking to the kitchen. Any walk can become a meditation if you bring full attention to it.

...

Today's invitation: at some point today, walk somewhere with full awareness. Even just for thirty seconds. Feel your feet, your steps, your body moving through space.

...

Day Five — done. You've now practised mindfulness in stillness and in motion. Tomorrow we'll explore bringing this awareness into everyday activities. See you then.

Thanks for practising with Salus.
