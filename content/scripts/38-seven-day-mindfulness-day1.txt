This is Day One. The beginning of something simple.

...

Over the next seven days, we're going to build a foundation in mindfulness. Step by step. Nothing overwhelming.

...

Each session is about ten minutes. That's all you need to give.

...

So let's start with the basics. What is mindfulness?

...

It's simpler than most people think. Mindfulness is paying attention to what's happening right now, on purpose, without judging it.

...

Right now, you're listening to my voice. You can feel your body sitting or lying down.

...

Maybe you can hear sounds around you. Maybe you have thoughts running about your day.

...

All of that is happening right now. Mindfulness is just noticing it. Not trying to change it. Just seeing it clearly.

...

...

Most of the time, we're on autopilot. Lost in thoughts about the past or the future.

...

Mindfulness pulls you back into your actual life. Into this moment. The only one that's real.

...

...

Today is about the breath. It all starts here. With breathing.

...

So let's begin. Get yourself comfortable.

...

You can be sitting in a chair, on a cushion, or lying down. Whatever works for you.

...

Just try to have a posture that's alert but relaxed. Not rigid, not slumped.

...

Close your eyes when you're ready. Or lower your gaze to a spot on the floor.

...

...

Take a moment to arrive. You've come from somewhere. Just let yourself land here.

...

You're not doing anything now except this.

...

...

Take a deep breath in through your nose.

[4 second pause]

And exhale slowly through your mouth. Let your shoulders drop.

[6 second pause]

One more like that. A deep breath in.

[4 second pause]

And let it go. Release any tension you're carrying.

[6 second pause]

Now let your breathing return to normal. Natural, easy, uncontrolled.

...

You're not trying to breathe in any special way. Just letting your body breathe how it wants to.

...

...

Bring your attention to the breath. Find the place in your body where you notice it most.

...

It might be your nostrils, where you feel cool air coming in and warm air going out.

...

Or your chest, where you feel the gentle rise and fall.

...

Or your belly, where there's a soft expansion and contraction.

...

Pick one of those spots. There's no wrong answer. And rest your attention there.

...

...

Just feel each breath as it comes and goes.

...

You don't need to count. You don't need to label anything. Just feel the breath happening.

...

...

I'm going to be quiet now for a little while. Just stay with the breath. When your mind wanders, gently bring it back.

...

[60 second pause]

...

If you've drifted, that's completely fine. Come back to the feeling of the next breath.

...

...

Here's the thing about wandering. When you notice your mind has drifted, you've just been mindful.

...

You woke up from the daydream. That's the skill we're building.

...

So when it happens, don't get frustrated. Just come back to the breath.

...

...

[30 second pause]

...

Notice the rhythm of your breathing. It doesn't need to be deep or slow or special. Just natural.

...

...

...

Now gently begin to widen your attention.

...

Instead of focusing narrowly on the breath, let yourself become aware of your whole body.

...

The sounds around you. The temperature of the air on your skin.

...

...

Take a slightly deeper breath in through your nose.

[4 second pause]

And let it out slowly through your mouth.

[6 second pause]

...

Before we close, here's something to carry with you today.

...

Try to bring a little of this attention into your daily life. Just moments here and there.

...

When you're drinking your tea, actually taste it. When you're walking, feel your feet on the ground.

...

You don't have to do it all day. Just little pockets of presence.

...

...

Gently open your eyes when you're ready.

...

Take a moment to notice how you feel. Whatever it is, that's a good starting point.

...

...

...

Thank you for practicing with Salus. Sleep, relax, restore.
