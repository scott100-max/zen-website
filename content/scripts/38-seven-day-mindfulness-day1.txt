Today you are starting a seven-day mindfulness practice.

...

Each session is around ten minutes. Over the next week you will build a real foundation, one step at a time.

...

Today is about arriving. Not achieving anything or mastering a skill, just arriving here with nothing else to do.

...

......

Get yourself comfortable. Sitting or lying down, whatever allows you to stay alert without straining.

...

When you are ready, allow your eyes to close and let your hands rest wherever they fall.

...

......

Inhale slowly through your nose, taking your time with it.

[SILENCE: 4]

And let it go through your mouth, letting your shoulders drop as you exhale.

[SILENCE: 6]

Now let your breathing find its own rhythm. No need to guide it in any way.

...

......

Your only task right now is to notice the breath as it moves in and out.

...

You might notice it at the tip of your nose, where the air is cooler coming in and warmer going out.

...

Or in your chest, where it rises and softens with each breath.

...

Or in your belly, where there is a gentle expansion and release.

...

Whichever spot draws your attention, rest there. That is your anchor for today.

...

Follow each breath as it arrives, and follow it as it leaves.

...

At some point your mind will wander. That is not a problem, it is what minds do all the time.

...

When you notice the wandering, return to the next breath. No judgement needed. That is the whole practice.

...

I am going to leave some quiet now. Stay with the breath, and when you drift, come back.

[SILENCE: 30]

...

If your attention has moved, that is fine. Return to the breath now, wherever you notice it most.

...

Noticing the drift is itself a moment of awareness. Every return to the breath is the practice working.

...

......

As we close, widen your attention from the breath to the room around you.

...

Notice whatever sounds are present. Notice the weight of your body where it rests.

...

Inhale once more through your nose, slowly and fully.

[SILENCE: 4]

And release everything on the exhale, letting your whole body soften.

...

Carry a little of this attention into the next hour. Not all day, just a moment here and there.

...

When you are ready, let your eyes open at their own pace.

...

That is Day One. You showed up, and that is the foundation for everything that follows.

...

Thank you for practising with Salus. See you tomorrow for Day Two.
