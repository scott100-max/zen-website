7-DAY MINDFULNESS COURSE: DAY 1
Duration: 10 minutes
Style: Warm, grounded male narrator

Welcome to Salus.

And welcome to Day One of your seven-day mindfulness course. I'm glad you're here. Over the next week, we're going to build a solid foundation in mindfulness — step by step, day by day. Nothing overwhelming. Just clear, practical guidance and daily practice.

Let me tell you what to expect. Each session is about ten minutes. That's it. Ten minutes a day for seven days. By the end of the week, you'll have a real understanding of what mindfulness is, how it works, and — most importantly — you'll have experienced it for yourself.

...

So let's start with the basics. What is mindfulness, actually?

It's simpler than most people think. Mindfulness is paying attention to what's happening right now, on purpose, without judging it. That's it.

Right now, you're listening to my voice. You can probably feel your body sitting or lying down. Maybe you can hear sounds in the background. You might have thoughts running — about your day, about whether this will work, about what you need to do later.

All of that is happening right now. Mindfulness is just noticing it. Not trying to change it. Not deciding if it's good or bad. Just seeing it clearly.

...

And here's why that matters. Most of the time, we're on autopilot. We're lost in thoughts about the past or the future. We eat without tasting. We listen without hearing. We go through whole days without really being present for any of it.

Mindfulness pulls you back into your actual life. Into this moment, which is the only one that's real.

...

Now, this week we're going to explore mindfulness through different lenses. Today is about the breath. Tomorrow we'll work with the body. Later in the week we'll bring mindfulness to thoughts, emotions, everyday activities, and more. Each day builds on the one before.

But it all starts here. With breathing.

...

So let's begin the practice. Get yourself comfortable. You can be sitting in a chair with your feet on the floor, on a meditation cushion, or lying down — whatever works for you. Just try to have a posture that's alert but relaxed. Not rigid, not slumped.

...

Close your eyes. Or if you prefer, lower your gaze to a spot on the floor.

...

Take a moment to arrive. You've come from somewhere — maybe a busy morning, maybe a long day. Just let yourself land here. Feel the transition. You're not doing anything now except this.

...

Take a deep breath in through your nose.

...

And exhale slowly through your mouth. Let it be a releasing breath. Let your shoulders drop.

...

One more like that. Deep breath in.

...

And exhale, letting go of any tension you're carrying.

...

Now let your breathing return to normal. Natural, easy, uncontrolled. You're not trying to breathe in any special way — just letting your body breathe the way it wants to.

...

And now, bring your attention to the breath. Find the place in your body where you notice it most. Common spots are the nostrils, where you feel cool air coming in and warm air going out. Or the chest, where you feel the gentle rise and fall. Or the belly, where there's a soft expansion and contraction.

Pick one of those spots. There's no wrong answer. And rest your attention there.

...

Just feel each breath as it comes in.

...

And as it goes out.

...

In.

...

Out.

...

You don't need to count. You don't need to label. You don't need to do anything with the breath. Just feel it. Know it's happening.

...

...

...

Now, at some point — probably very soon — you'll notice that your attention has drifted. You'll be thinking about something else entirely. That's not a mistake. That's actually the most important moment in this practice.

When you notice your mind has wandered, you've just been mindful. You woke up from the daydream. That's the skill we're building.

So when it happens, don't get frustrated. Just acknowledge it — "I was thinking" — and gently guide your attention back to the breath.

Let's continue. Following the breath. Coming back when you wander.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

If you've drifted, that's okay. Come back to the breath. Feel the next inhale.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Notice the rhythm of your breathing. It doesn't need to be deep or slow or special. Just natural. Just as it is.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Good.

...

Now, gently begin to widen your attention. Instead of focusing narrowly on the breath, let yourself become aware of your whole body sitting here. The sounds in the room. The temperature of the air.

...

Take a slightly deeper breath in.

...

And let it out with a sigh.

...

Before we close, I want to set an intention for this week. You've just committed to seven days of mindfulness practice. That's a real commitment, and it matters.

So here's what I'd ask: over the next seven days, try to bring a little bit of this attention into your daily life. Just moments here and there. When you're drinking your tea, actually taste it. When you're walking somewhere, feel your feet on the ground. When someone is talking to you, really listen.

You don't have to do it all day. Just moments. Little pockets of presence.

...

And show up here tomorrow. Day Two. We'll build on what you've started today.

...

Gently open your eyes when you're ready. Take a moment to notice how you feel. Whatever it is, that's a good starting point.

...

Day One — done. Well done.

Thanks for practising with Salus. I'll see you tomorrow.
