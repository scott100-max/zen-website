Welcome to One Small Thing. This is a gentle exercise.
...
This session is for those days when everything looks heavy. When even ordinary tasks demand more energy than you seem to have. When the gap between where you are and where you want to be looks impossibly wide.
...
We are not going to close that gap today. We are going to ignore it entirely and focus on something much smaller.
......
Wherever you are right now, let yourself stop. Not collapse, not give up, just stop moving for a few minutes. Let your body rest exactly where it is.
...
Close your eyes if you like, or leave them open. Either is fine. This is not a meditation. It is a conversation.
......
When low mood settles in, it changes the rules. Things that were once automatic now require enormous effort. Getting dressed, replying to a message, making something to eat. Each one becomes a negotiation with yourself.
...
And because each small task now carries the weight of something much bigger, it is tempting to wait. Wait until you have more energy. Wait until you are ready. Wait until the mood lifts on its own.
...
The difficulty is that mood rarely lifts on its own. Low mood feeds on inactivity, and inactivity feeds on low mood. It is a loop, and waiting for it to break by itself is like waiting for a stopped clock to restart.
......
The way to break the loop is not through a dramatic effort. It is not about forcing yourself to go for a run or clean the entire house or suddenly become productive. Those ambitions are too large, and when they inevitably fail, the loop tightens.
...
The way to break the loop is with one small thing. One action so modest, so unthreatening, that even at your lowest you can manage it. That is all we are looking for today.
......
So let me ask you to think about three areas of your life right now. Not in any depth. Just a brief glance at each one.
...
First, purpose. Is there something, anything, that would give you the smallest sense of accomplishment today? Not a grand achievement. Something as small as replying to one message, putting one thing away, writing one sentence.
...
Take a moment to sit with that question. What small thing comes to mind?
[SILENCE: 15s]
Second, enjoyment. Is there something that might bring you even a faint glimmer of comfort or satisfaction? A cup of tea, a song you like, a few pages of something you are reading, standing outside for two minutes.
...
Take a moment to sit with this one too. Is there anything that comes to mind?
[SILENCE: 15s]
Third, connection. Is there someone you could reach out to, even briefly? A text that says hello. A voice message. Sitting in the same room as someone, even without conversation.
...
Take a moment with this last question. Who comes to mind?
[SILENCE: 15s]
You now have three candidates. Three possible small things. You do not need to do all three. You do not even need to do any of them right now. But if you can choose one, just one, that is enough.
......
The action itself barely matters. What matters is the signal it sends to your brain. When you complete one small thing, your brain registers a tiny success. And that success, however modest, loosens the grip of the loop by a fraction.
...
One small thing becomes two. Two becomes a handful. The mood does not lift in one dramatic moment. It shifts gradually, through accumulated small movements. Each one almost too small to notice on its own.
......
If the one small thing you have chosen still looks too large, make it smaller. Cut it in half. And if that half still looks daunting, cut it again. There is no such thing as too small.
...
Getting out of bed, opening the curtains, drinking a glass of water, none of those are too small. Every one is a decision you made and an action you completed, and that counts.
......
For the next few moments, just sit with the one small thing you have chosen. Not planning it in detail, not worrying about when or how. Just holding the intention gently.
[SILENCE: 20s]
Now let that intention rest. You will carry it with you when this session ends, and you will act on it when you are ready.
...
Bring your attention back to the room around you. Notice the weight of your body, the air on your skin, the quiet of this moment.
...
Open your eyes whenever you are ready. And when you are, begin with one small thing. That is more than enough.
...
Thank you for listening to this today. That was already one small thing.
