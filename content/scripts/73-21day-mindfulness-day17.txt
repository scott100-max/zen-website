Name five things you can see.

...

Go on. Look around and name them. A lamp. A wall. Your hands. A window. Something else. Five objects. Hold them all in your awareness at once.

...

...

Good. Now close your eyes. In an instant, all five are gone. Your visual world has been reduced to nothing, and yet you are still here. The awareness that was holding those five things did not disappear. It just has nothing to hold.

...

...

Today we are going to work with that awareness directly. Not by adding things to focus on, but by taking them away. One anchor at a time, until nothing is left except the awareness itself.

...

This practice is called choiceless awareness, and it is considered one of the most advanced techniques in contemplative traditions. You are ready for it. Everything you have built over the past sixteen days leads here.

...

...

...

Close your eyes, and begin by placing your attention on your breath. The familiar anchor. The one you have used since day two.

...

...

Stay with the breath for a minute. Notice its rhythm, its temperature, its texture. Let it be your entire world.

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

Now let the breath go. Do not stop breathing, obviously, but release it as an object of attention. Let it fade into the background the way a ticking clock fades when you stop listening for it.

...

...

Shift your attention to the body. The full body, all at once. The floodlight awareness you practised on day three. Hold the entire body in attention without scanning or searching.

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

Now let the body go too. Release it as a focus. Let it become background noise. Do not try to stop sensing your body, just stop directing attention toward it.

...

...

Shift to sounds. Open your hearing wide and let the soundscape fill the space where the body was. Near, mid, far. The full layered listening you learned on day five.

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

Now let the sounds go. Release them as an anchor. They will continue arriving, but you are no longer reaching for them.

...

...

What is left when every anchor has been taken away?

...

...

This is the space between. No anchor. No focus. No technique. No effort. Just awareness itself, holding nothing in particular, open to everything.

...

...

For most people, the first response is panic. The mind reaches for something to grab. A thought, a sensation, a sound. That is normal. When the mind has nothing to focus on, it gets restless.

...

But you have spent sixteen days training your ability to notice that restlessness without reacting to it. So notice it. Watch the reaching. And then let the reaching go too.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

In choiceless awareness, whatever shows up is the meditation. A sound arises, and you notice it, and you do not chase it. A thought appears, and you see it, and you let it dissolve. A sensation blooms somewhere in the body, and you acknowledge it, and you return to the open space.

...

You are not choosing what to attend to. You are letting experience come to you. The difference is subtle but profound. Active attention is a torch. This is more like a mirror. It reflects whatever appears without going anywhere.

...

...

...

Jiddu Krishnamurti called this observation without the observer. When there is no fixed point of attention, no agenda, no preference, the separation between you and your experience starts to dissolve. There is just experience, happening, and awareness, receiving it.

...

...

Do not try to make this happen. It is not something you produce. It is what remains when you stop producing.

...

...

...

I am going to leave you in extended quiet now. This is the longest silence we have shared so far. Your only instruction is to stay open. When the mind reaches for an anchor, notice the reaching, and let it go. When it tries to evaluate how the meditation is going, notice that too, and let it go.

...

There is nothing to achieve here. Nothing to get right. Just space, and whatever moves through it.

[SILENCE: 180]

...

...

...

...

Very gently, begin to let the structured world come back. Notice the body first, because it is closest. Then the sounds. Then the breath. Each anchor returning like lights coming on in a dark room.

...

...

...

There is no rush. Let each layer arrive in its own time.

...

...

When you are ready, let your eyes open, and take in the visual world. The objects, the colours, the depth. Notice whether they look any different after spending time in pure awareness.

...

...

...

Your homework is two minutes, and it is one of the most important exercises you will do. At some point today, sit for two minutes with no technique at all. No breath counting, no body scan, no sound focus. Just sit. No anchor, no agenda, no instruction. See what happens when you stop trying to meditate and just exist.

...

...

You are in the final stretch. Four days to go. See you tomorrow.
