Make two fists. Clench them hard.

...

Hold them tight. As tight as you can. Notice how quickly the tension spreads from your hands up through your wrists, your forearms, your shoulders. Your jaw probably tightened too.

...

...

Now imagine holding your fists like that for a day. A week. A year. Imagine the exhaustion. The chronic ache. The way it would limit everything else you tried to do. That is what unforgiveness does. Not to the person who wronged you. To you.

...

...

You can open your hands now. Let them rest. Notice the relief that floods in the moment you stop gripping.

...

...

...

Today you are going to practise forgiveness. And I need to be very clear about what that means, because the word carries more misunderstanding than almost any other in the English language.

...

Forgiveness does not mean what happened was acceptable. It does not mean you condone it, excuse it, or pretend it did not matter. It does not mean you have to reconcile with anyone, or trust anyone again, or even speak to them.

...

...

Forgiveness means you stop carrying the weight. You put down the clenched fist. You choose to stop spending your energy on something that is already in the past, and redirect that energy toward the life you are living now.

...

...

...

This is grounded in decades of research. Psychologist Robert Enright's forgiveness therapy has been shown to reduce anxiety, depression, and chronic anger. Not because forgiveness is morally superior, but because the body and mind cannot hold a grudge and be well at the same time. The grip costs too much.

...

...

Close your eyes, and let your hands rest open on your lap or beside you. Notice the openness of your palms.

...

...

...

We are going to work in three layers. Start with the lightest. Think of a small grievance. Someone who cut you off in traffic. A friend who forgot something important. A colleague who took credit for your work. Something that still carries a small charge but is not devastating.

...

...

Bring this situation to mind and notice where you tighten. The jaw, the chest, the stomach, the fists. The body remembers the grievance even when the mind tries to dismiss it.

...

...

[SILENCE: 20]

...

...

Now, without forcing anything, experiment with this phrase, silently. I am putting this down. Not because it does not matter, but because carrying it costs me more than it is worth.

...

...

Notice what happens in your body as you say those words. For some people, there is an immediate softening. For others, resistance. Both responses are honest. There is no requirement to forgive on command. You are just practising the gesture.

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

...

...

...

Now move to the second layer. Think of a deeper grievance. Someone who hurt you in a way that left a mark. A relationship that ended badly. A betrayal that changed how you see people. Not the most painful thing in your history, but something real.

...

...

This is harder. The grip is stronger here. The body has been holding this one for longer, and it does not let go quickly. That is alright. Today is about direction, not completion. You do not need to fully forgive anything right now. You just need to turn toward the possibility.

...

...

...

Bring this situation into your awareness. Notice the familiar tightening. Notice the thoughts that come with it. He should not have done that. She knew better. They never apologised. These thoughts are the fist, clenching around the grievance, keeping it alive.

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

Offer the same phrase, or something close to it. I am beginning to put this down. I am not there yet, and that is fine. But I am facing the direction of release.

...

...

You do not have to mean it completely. You just have to mean the wanting to mean it. That is enough to start the process.

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

...

The third layer is the hardest, and it is optional. If you are not ready for this, stay with the second layer. There is no hierarchy of progress here. But if you are willing, turn the forgiveness practice toward yourself.

...

...

Think of something you have not forgiven yourself for. Something you did, or failed to do, that you carry with you. Something the inner critic returns to again and again.

...

...

...

Notice where this one lives in your body. Self-directed grievance often sits differently from grievance toward others. It tends to live in the chest, or behind the eyes, or in the pit of the stomach. It has a heaviness that comes from being both the prosecutor and the defendant.

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

Offer yourself the same possibility. I am beginning to put this down. What I did was human. Carrying it forever does not undo it. I am allowed to move forward.

...

...

Again, you do not need to fully arrive there today. You just need to face the direction. The body will catch up with the intention over time.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 60]

...

...

Forgiveness is not an event. It is a direction. You face it the way you face a compass heading, not by arriving but by turning. And every time you turn, the grip loosens slightly. Not all at once. But measurably. Reliably. Over time.

...

...

...

I am going to leave you in extended quiet now. Let your hands rest open. Let whatever wants to soften, soften. Let whatever is not ready, wait. There is no deadline for any of this.

[SILENCE: 120]

...

...

...

...

Gently bring the room back. Notice the sounds first, then the temperature, then the surface beneath you.

...

...

Open your eyes when you are ready, and notice the state of your hands. Are they open or closed?

...

...

Your homework takes no time at all. At some point today, notice what you are still gripping. A grudge, a regret, a resentment, anything. You do not have to put it down. Just notice that your hands are clenched, and know that they can open whenever you choose.

...

...

Tomorrow, we enter the territory of open awareness. The most advanced practice in the course. See you then.
