Welcome to The Gardener's Almanac.

...

Lay back and relax. Allow your mind to sleepily wander, while I gently read you this bedtime story.

...

......

......

......

There is a garden. It sits behind a stone wall, at the end of a lane that nobody drives down any more.

...

The gate is wooden. Pale green paint, peeling in places. It opens with a sound that belongs to another century. A low creak, followed by a click as the latch catches behind you.

...

You step inside.

...

The first thing you notice is the air. It is different here. Cooler. Wetter. Full of the soft green smell of things growing.

...

The garden is old and well tended. Not manicured. Not fussy. Tended in the way that only patience and years of knowing a piece of ground can produce.

...

There are raised beds made of weathered brick, low and wide. They are planted in neat rows. Lettuces, beans climbing up cane tripods, herbs spilling over the edges.

...

Between the beds, the paths are gravel. Small grey stones that crunch gently under your feet as you walk.

...

......

Along the south-facing wall, there are fruit trees trained flat against the stone. Espaliered apple and pear, their branches spread out like open hands.

...

The wall behind them holds the warmth of the afternoon sun and releases it slowly. You can feel it radiating off the stone, even now.

...

A wooden bench sits against this wall. Simple. Slatted. The kind that has been here so long it has taken on the colour of the stone behind it.

...

You sit down.

...

The bench is warm. The wall behind you is warm. The air around you is still and quiet and golden with late afternoon light.

...

......

From here you can see the whole garden laid out before you. Each bed. Each path. Each small and careful thing.

...

In the nearest bed, there are tomato plants tied to wooden stakes with soft green twine. The fruits are just beginning to colour. Green turning to pale orange at the shoulders.

...

Next to them, a row of courgettes. Broad, dark leaves spreading out like parasols, hiding the yellow flowers underneath.

...

Beyond that, a herb bed. You can smell it from here. Rosemary, thyme, and something sweeter beneath them. Basil, perhaps. Or marjoram.

...

......

The garden makes its own sounds. Small sounds. Private sounds that only sit still long enough to hear.

...

A bee working the lavender border. The dry rustle of a leaf turning in a current of air you cannot feel.

...

Somewhere behind the wall, a wood pigeon is calling. That low, unhurried phrase it repeats without variation. A sound that means summer in a particular way nothing else does.

...

......

There is a greenhouse at the far end. Glass and iron, slightly crooked with age. The door is propped open with a brick and you can see seed trays on the shelf inside.

...

Small green shoots, uniform and hopeful. Each one a quiet act of faith in the weeks ahead.

...

......

A watering can sits on the path near your feet. Galvanised metal, dented and genuine. A tool that has done real work, every day, for years.

...

Imagine picking it up. It is heavy, full to the brim. You tip it gently and a smooth arc of water falls across the bed in front of you.

...

The soil darkens where the water lands. You can smell it immediately. That deep, complex, ancient smell of wet earth.

...

You water slowly. Moving along the row with no hurry at all. Watching each plant receive what it needs.

...

The beans. The tomatoes. The herbs.

...

Each one takes the water differently. The rosemary lets it bead and run off. The basil drinks it down immediately. The tomato leaves darken and shine.

...

......

You set the watering can down and sit back on the bench.

...

The light is changing now. The golden afternoon is softening toward evening. Shadows are lengthening across the gravel paths.

...

The temperature drops by a degree. Then another. The warmth from the wall behind you becomes something you lean into.

...

......

An old gardening book sits on the bench beside you. Leather cover, soft from use. The Gardener's Almanac, it says on the spine. The letters are almost worn away.

...

You open it somewhere in the middle. The pages are thick and cream-coloured. There are handwritten notes in the margins. Planting dates. Varieties. Small observations about weather and soil.

...

Sow broad beans in November. Prune the pear after the third year. The south bed needs lime every spring.

...

The handwriting changes over the years. Younger, more hurried entries at the front. Slower, more considered notes toward the back. A life recorded in the margins of a garden.

...

......

You close the book and rest your hands on it.

...

The garden is settling into evening now. The colours are becoming richer and deeper. The greens are darker. The brick of the raised beds has turned a warm, dusky red.

...

A blackbird lands on the path and tilts its head. It watches you for a long moment, then hops forward twice, picks something from the gravel, and flies to the top of the wall.

...

Its song begins. Clear and liquid and absurdly beautiful for something so small. It fills the garden.

...

......

The air is cooling steadily now. You can feel the dew beginning to form. A faint dampness on the wooden slats of the bench. On the leaves of the courgettes.

...

Everything is slowing down. The garden is putting itself to bed the way it has done every evening for a hundred years.

...

......

In the greenhouse, the warmth of the day is trapped under glass. The seedlings in their trays are still and dark. Growing in their own time. In their own silence.

...

The watering can gleams faintly in the half-light. The gravel paths are pale lines between the darker beds.

...

......

You lean back against the wall. It still holds some warmth. Enough.

...

The blackbird has finished singing. The wood pigeon has gone quiet. The bee has returned to wherever bees go when the light fades.

...

The only sound is the garden breathing. That barely audible rustling of a thousand leaves adjusting themselves for the night.

...

......

You do not need to be anywhere else. There is nothing to tend to. Nothing to water. Nothing to plant or prune or plan.

...

The almanac rests on your lap. The bench holds you. The wall supports you. The garden surrounds you.

...

......

The sky above the garden wall is deep blue now. The first stars are beginning to appear.

...

Faint at first. Then clearer. One by one. Pinpoints of light in a sky that is becoming vast and dark and still.

...

......

The garden is asleep. You are the last one here. And there is nothing left to do except close your eyes and let the quiet carry you.

...

......

Rest here. In the garden. Behind the wall. Where everything grows slowly, and nothing is rushed, and the air smells of rosemary and wet stone and evening.

...

......

......

Thank you for practising with Sālus. Sleep well.
