GRATITUDE BEFORE SLEEP
Duration: 15 minutes
Style: Warm, grounded male narrator

---

Welcome to Salus.

It's the end of the day. And whatever kind of day it was — good, bad, long, short, ordinary, extraordinary — you made it through. You're here now. And for the next fifteen minutes, we're going to do something simple but genuinely powerful before you sleep. We're going to practise gratitude.

Now, I know "gratitude practice" can sound a bit self-helpy. But the research on this is remarkably consistent. People who regularly reflect on what they're grateful for sleep better, feel more positive emotions, deal with adversity more effectively, and have stronger relationships.

And tonight's version is designed to carry you right into sleep. So get comfortable. Ideally you're already in bed, lying down, covers pulled up. Drifting off is not just allowed — it's encouraged.

...

Close your eyes. Let your body sink into the mattress. Feel the weight of your limbs. Feel the pillow beneath your head.

...

Take a slow breath in through your nose. Fill your lungs gently. No rush.

...

And let it out like a long sigh. Feel your shoulders melt into the bed.

...

Another breath in. Slow and easy.

...

And out. Letting the whole day drain out of your body. Everything you carried — let it go.

...

...

...

Good. Now, we're going to start with something specific. I want you to think back over today — this particular day, the one that's ending right now — and find three good things that happened.

They don't have to be big. In fact, the smaller the better. A good cup of coffee. A moment of laughter. Sunshine through a window. A task completed. A moment of quiet.

Just three things. Let them come to you. Even on the worst days, there are three.

...

...

...

...

Do you have your first one? Hold it in your mind. Go back to that moment. Not just the fact of it, but the feeling.

...

...

Let yourself really savour it. We so often rush past the good things. Tonight, we're letting them register.

...

...

Silently say thank you for that moment. Just an acknowledgement. "That was good. I'm grateful."

...

...

Now, let that one settle, and bring up the second one. The second good thing from today.

...

...

See it clearly. Remember the details. Let yourself feel it again.

...

...

What made this one matter? Let the feeling land.

...

...

Say thank you for this one too.

...

...

And now the third. Your third good thing from today.

...

...

Hold it. Remember it. Feel it. Let it fill you up the way the warmth of a fire fills a cold room — gradually, gently, from the inside out.

...

...

...

Thank you.

...

...

...

Notice how something has shifted. Even slightly. That's gratitude at work. It doesn't erase the hard parts. It just makes sure the good parts get equal airtime.

...

...

...

Let's go a little wider now. Beyond just today. Into the broader landscape of your life.

...

...

Think about someone in your life who you're grateful for. Someone who has made your life better just by being in it. A partner, a parent, a child, a friend, a mentor. Someone whose presence matters.

...

...

Picture them. See their face. Remember a specific moment with them — a conversation, a gesture, a time they showed up for you, a time they made you laugh.

...

...

...

Feel the warmth of that connection. You don't have to say anything to them. Just feel it.

...

...

Now think about your body. This body that carried you through today. That breathed for you, walked for you, digested your food, healed small wounds without you even noticing. Can you feel some gratitude for it? Not for how it looks — for what it does.

...

...

...

Take a breath and feel it fill your lungs. What an extraordinary thing that is, when you stop to feel it.

...

...

Now widen further. The place you live. The bed beneath you. The roof above you. The fact that you ate today. That you had clean water. That you're alive, here, with the capacity to reflect and feel and grow.

These things are easy to take for granted. But tonight, let them come into focus.

...

...

...

...

...

Good. Now, let all of that go. Let the images dissolve. Let the thoughts thin out. Let the gratitude remain as a feeling — a warmth, a softness, a quiet fullness — but release the words and pictures and memories.

...

...

Just lie here. Breathing slowly. Body heavy and warm. Mind growing quieter.

...

...

...

Feel the comfort of the bed beneath you. The darkness behind your closed eyes. The quiet of the night settling in around you.

...

...

...

If thoughts come, let them pass like clouds drifting across a night sky. You don't need to follow them. You don't need to solve anything tonight. You don't need to plan tomorrow. Everything can wait. Everything will still be there in the morning. But right now, there is only this. Only rest. Only peace.

...

...

...

...

With each exhale, let yourself sink a little deeper into the mattress. A little deeper into stillness. A little deeper into the warm, dark, quiet space of approaching sleep.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Deeper into comfort. Deeper into rest. Deeper into the feeling of being held by the night.

...

...

...

...

...

...

Your body knows how to sleep. It's done it thousands of times. You don't have to make it happen. You don't have to try. Just stop holding on — to thoughts, to wakefulness, to control — and sleep will come on its own. Like a tide coming in. Like dusk becoming dark.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

The day is done. You did your best. And your best was good enough. You are enough. You have always been enough.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Let sleep come now. Let it wash over you, soft and warm and complete. Let the last thoughts dissolve. Let the last tension release. Let go.

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

Goodnight. Sleep well. You are safe.

Thanks for practising with Salus. I'll see you when you wake.
