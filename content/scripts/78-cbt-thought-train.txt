Welcome to The Thought Train, a defusion exercise.
...
This is a thought defusion exercise. Over the next fifteen minutes, you will practise a different way of relating to your thoughts.
...
Most of us treat thoughts as commands. A thought arrives and we obey it, argue with it, or try to push it away. All three of those responses give the thought more power than it deserves.
...
There is a fourth option. You can watch the thought arrive, acknowledge it, and let it move on without doing anything at all.
......
To begin, allow your body to arrive in a comfortable position. Sitting or lying down, whichever suits you right now.
...
Let your hands rest wherever they have landed. Let your shoulders drop a fraction lower than they are.
...
Close your eyes if that is comfortable, or soften your gaze towards the ground.
......
Now bring your attention to the rhythm of your breathing. Not changing it, just noticing it. The cool air entering through your nose. The gentle rise of your chest. The warm air leaving again.
...
Stay with that rhythm for a few breaths. No agenda, no effort required. Just the steady movement of air in and out.
......
In a moment, I am going to ask you to imagine a train platform. Not a busy one. A quiet country station, early in the morning, before the rush has begun.
...
Picture yourself sitting on a wooden bench on this platform. The air is cool and clear. You can hear birds in the distance. There is no one else here. You are just sitting, watching, waiting.
......
From far down the track, you hear a low rumble. A train is approaching. As it draws closer, you notice something written on the side of each carriage.
...
Each carriage carries a thought. One of your thoughts. It might be a worry, a memory, a plan, a criticism, a random observation. Whatever your mind has produced, it is written there on the side of the train.
...
The train pulls into the station and stops briefly. The doors open. You could board this train. You could climb on, sit down, and ride wherever that thought wants to take you.
...
But you do not have to board. You can read what is written on the carriage, nod, and stay on your bench. The doors will close. The train will leave. And you will still be here, sitting quietly.
......
Let us try this now. Sit on your bench and wait for the first thought to arrive.
...
Whatever comes to mind next, picture it written on the side of a carriage pulling into your station. Read it. Notice what it says.
...
Now notice the pull. Does this thought want you to board? Does it want you to engage, to solve, to react? Just notice that pull without acting on it.
...
And now let the doors close. Watch the train pull away from the station, growing smaller down the track until it is gone.
......
Another train is already approaching. This is how minds work. Thoughts arrive one after another, all day long. There is no stopping them. That is not the goal.
...
The goal is what you are doing right now. Watching from the bench. Reading the carriages. Choosing not to board.
......
Let us sit with this for a while. Each time a thought arrives, picture it on a carriage. Read it. Let the train stop. Notice any urge to climb aboard.
...
And then let it pass. You do not have to board. You do not have to push the train away either. Just let it arrive and let it leave, in its own time.
[SILENCE: 60s]
If you notice that you have boarded a train without realising it, that is perfectly normal. It happens to everyone. You have not failed at anything.
...
The moment you notice you are on the train is the moment you are back on the bench. That awareness is the entire practice. Just return to watching.
...
Let a few more trains arrive and depart. Stay on your bench. Stay curious about what arrives, without judging it or yourself.
[SILENCE: 60s]
Some trains will be louder than others. Some will be brightly coloured, demanding your attention. Some will stop for a long time, doors wide open, almost daring you to get on.
...
Notice which trains pull hardest. What kind of thoughts have the strongest magnetic force for you? Worries about tomorrow? Replays of yesterday? Criticisms about who you are?
...
Whatever it is, you do not need to solve that right now. Just notice the pattern. That awareness alone is valuable.
......
Your brain generates hundreds of sentences every hour. Most of them are noise. A thought only has the authority you give it, and right now, you are giving it none. It is just words on the side of a passing train.
...
The thoughts belong to your mind. The bench belongs to you. One produces noise, the other observes it. You have been practising the observation.
......
Let us sit here for one more minute. Let a few final trains pass through your quiet station. Some fast, some slow. Some carrying heavy words, some light ones. All of them passing.
[SILENCE: 40s]
Now gently let the image of the platform begin to fade. You do not need to hold onto it.
...
Bring your attention back to the room around you. Notice the surface beneath you, the temperature of the air, any sounds nearby.
...
Breathe in slowly. And as you breathe out, let your eyes open whenever you are ready.
...
The bench is always there. Whenever your thoughts grow loud, you can return to it. Sit down, watch the trains, and remember that you never have to board.
...
Thank you for taking the time to practise with me today.
