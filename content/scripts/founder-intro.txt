Hi. I'm Scott, and I'm the founder of Salus.

I wanted to make this video because I think it's important you know who's behind what you're using. We're not a tech company. We're not backed by investors. We're a family.

My journey with meditation and mental health started over forty years ago — long before there were apps for it, long before the iPhone, before "wellness" was even a word people used. I've been through CBT, counselling, ASMR, every relaxation technique you can think of. I've tried every meditation method out there. Not because it was trendy — because I needed it.

I've lived with anxiety. I've struggled with sleep. And over the years, I found that these tools genuinely work. Breathing exercises, guided meditation, mindfulness — they changed my life. Not overnight, but consistently, over time.

A few years ago, something clicked. My daughter Ella finished her master's degree in psychology. She'd already got a first-class honours in her undergraduate. And I realised — we had something unusual under one roof. Decades of lived experience, and proper clinical expertise.

That's when Salus was born. Not in a boardroom. In our living room.

Every session on Salus is clinically reviewed by Ella. Every technique is evidence-based. We don't make things up. We don't use buzzwords. If it's on Salus, it's because the research supports it and because we've used it ourselves.

Here's what makes us different from the big apps. We're not trying to lock you into a subscription and forget about you. We don't charge you separately for sleep and meditation. We don't gamify your mental health with streaks and guilt. Everything is included in one plan — and there's plenty you can use completely free.

And if you ever need to talk to someone — about a session, about your experience, about anything — you can contact us directly. A real person will read your message and reply. That's not a marketing line. That's just how we do things.

Salus means health, safety, and well-being in Latin. We chose it because that's exactly what we're here for. To help you sleep better. Relax more. And restore yourself — whatever that looks like for you.

Thank you for being here. It means more than you know.

Sleep. Relax. Restore.
