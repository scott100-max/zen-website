This is a gentle breathing session for when anxiety feels heavy.

...

There's nothing complicated here. We're just going to breathe together.

...

Whatever you're feeling right now, that's okay. You don't need to fix anything.

...

...

Find somewhere comfortable to sit or lie down.

...

Let your shoulders drop. Unclench your jaw.

...

...

Close your eyes when you're ready.

...

...

...

Take a breath in through your nose. Nice and slow.

[4 second pause]

Now hold your breath gently.

[5 second pause]

And breathe out through your mouth. Let it all go.

[6 second pause]

...

There's no rush. Let your body settle.

...

...

...

Let's do that again. Breathe in slowly.

[4 second pause]

Now hold your breath gently.

[5 second pause]

And release. A long, slow breath out.

[6 second pause]

...

Good. You're already doing something kind for yourself.

...

...

...

One more time. Breathe in.

[4 second pause]

Now hold your breath.

[5 second pause]

And let it go completely.

[6 second pause]

...

...

Notice what's changed. Your chest may feel a little lighter.

...

Your shoulders may have softened.

...

...

Even a few breaths can make a difference.

...

...

[45 second pause]

Now we'll continue with a slower rhythm.

...

This time, the exhale is longer. Just let the air leave gently.

...

...

Breathe in through your nose.

[4 second pause]

Now hold your breath.

[5 second pause]

And exhale very slowly through your mouth.

[6 second pause]

...

...

I'll be quiet for a while now. Just keep breathing at your own pace. Let the birds hold you.

[60 second pause]

Welcome back. You're doing beautifully.

...

...

Let's do a few more together.

...

Take a slow breath in through your nose.

[4 second pause]

Now hold your breath gently.

[5 second pause]

And a long, slow breath out.

[6 second pause]

...

...

Once more. Breathe in when you're ready.

[4 second pause]

Now hold your breath softly.

[5 second pause]

And release everything. Let it all pour out of you.

[6 second pause]

...

...

I'm going to give you some quiet now. Stay with your breath. I'll be back soon.

[75 second pause]

You've been so patient with yourself. That matters more than you know.

...

...

...

These breaths are always with you.

...

Waiting in a queue. Before a difficult conversation. Lying awake at three in the morning.

...

...

You don't need an app or a quiet room. Just your breath.

...

...

...

Whenever anxiety rises, come back to this. Breathe in. Hold. Let go.

...

...

It won't make everything perfect. But it will make the next moment easier.

...

...

...

...

Now gently bring your attention back to the room.

...

Feel whatever is beneath you.

...

...

Notice the sounds around you.

...

Wiggle your fingers if you'd like.

...

...

When you're ready, open your eyes.

...

...

...

Thank you for practicing with Salus.

...

Sleep, relax, restore.
