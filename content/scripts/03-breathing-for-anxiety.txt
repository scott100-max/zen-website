If you're feeling anxious right now, you're in the right place. And you're going to feel better.

...
...

When you're anxious, your body activates its fight-or-flight response. Your heart rate increases, your breathing gets shallow, and your muscles tense. This is your nervous system trying to protect you.

...

But here's the key: your breath is the one part of this system you can control consciously. When you slow your exhale, you activate the vagus nerve, which signals your brain to switch from alert mode to rest mode.

...
...

I'm going to guide you through a simple breathing technique. Just follow my voice. There's nothing to count, nothing to remember. Just breathe when I tell you.

...

Sit comfortably and let your shoulders drop.

...
...

Breathe in slowly through your nose.

...

Now hold your breath gently.

...

And breathe out slowly through your mouth.

...
...

Let's do that again. Breathe in.

...

Now hold your breath.

...

Breathe out slowly.

...
...

Good. Keep going with me. Breathe in.

...

Now hold your breath.

...

And release.

...
...

Once more. Breathe in deeply.

...

Now hold your breath.

...

Breathe out completely.

...
...
...

Notice how you feel. Even after a few breaths, your body is already responding. Your shoulders may have dropped. Your chest may feel less tight.

...
...

Now I'll guide you through a second technique. This one has a longer exhale, which deepens the relaxation response. It's particularly good before sleep.

...

Place the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, just behind your front teeth.

...
...

Breathe in through your nose.

...

Now hold your breath.

...
...

And exhale very slowly through your mouth, making a soft whooshing sound.

...
...
...

Let's do that twice more. Breathe in.

...

Now hold your breath.

...
...

Exhale slowly and completely.

...
...
...

One more time. Breathe in.

...

Now hold your breath.

...
...

And let it all go.

...
...
...
...

Beautiful. You now have two tools that are always with you.

...

The first technique works for in-the-moment calm. Use it before a meeting, during a stressful conversation, or whenever you feel your chest tightening.

...

The longer exhale technique is ideal for winding down before sleep, or when anxious thoughts are spiralling.

...
...

The more you practice, the faster your body responds. Start with a few breaths and build from there.

...
...
...

You showed up for yourself today. That matters. I'll see you next time.

...
...

Sleep. Relax. Restore.
