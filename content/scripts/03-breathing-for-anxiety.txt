This is a gentle breathing session.

...

For when anxiety weighs you down.

...

There's nothing complicated here. We're just going to breathe together.

...

Whatever is happening right now, that's okay. You don't need to fix anything.

...

...

Find somewhere comfortable to sit or lie down.

...

Let your shoulders drop. Unclench your jaw.

...

...

Let your eyes fall shut when you're ready.

...

...

...

Breathe in through your nose. Nice and slow.

[SILENCE: 4]

Now hold your breath gently.

[SILENCE: 5]

And breathe out through your mouth. Let it all go.

[SILENCE: 6]

...

There's no rush. Let your body settle.

...

...

...

Let's do that again. Breathe in slowly.

[SILENCE: 4]

Now hold your breath gently.

[SILENCE: 5]

And release. A long, slow breath out.

[SILENCE: 6]

...

Good. You're already doing something kind for yourself.

...

...

...

One more time. Breathe in.

[SILENCE: 4]

Now hold your breath.

[SILENCE: 5]

And let it go completely.

[SILENCE: 6]

...

...

Notice what's changed. Your chest may seem a little lighter.

...

Your shoulders may have loosened.

...

...

Even a few breaths can make a difference.

...

...

[SILENCE: 45]

Now we'll continue with a slower rhythm.

...

This time, the exhale is longer. Just let the air leave gently.

...

...

Breathe in through your nose.

[SILENCE: 4]

Now hold your breath.

[SILENCE: 5]

And exhale very slowly through your mouth.

[SILENCE: 6]

...

...

I'll be quiet for a while now. Just keep breathing at your own pace. Let the birds hold you.

[SILENCE: 60]

Welcome back. You're doing beautifully.

...

...

Let's do a few more together.

...

Draw a slow breath through your nose.

[SILENCE: 4]

Now hold your breath gently.

[SILENCE: 5]

And a long, slow breath out.

[SILENCE: 6]

...

...

Once more. Breathe in when you're ready.

[SILENCE: 4]

Now hold your breath gently.

[SILENCE: 5]

And release everything. Let it all pour out of you.

[SILENCE: 6]

...

...

I'm going to give you some quiet now. Stay with your breath. I'll be back soon.

[SILENCE: 75]

You've been so patient with yourself. That matters more than you know.

...

...

...

These breaths are always with you.

...

Waiting in a queue. Before a difficult conversation. Lying awake at three in the morning.

...

...

You don't need an app or a quiet room. Just your breath.

...

...

...

Whenever anxiety rises, come back to this. Breathe in. Hold. Let go.

...

...

It won't make everything perfect. But it will make the next moment easier.

...

...

...

...

Now gently bring your attention back to the room.

...

Notice whatever is beneath you.

...

...

Notice the sounds around you.

...

Wiggle your fingers if you'd like.

...

...

When you're ready, open your eyes.

...

...

...

Thank you for practicing with Salus.

...

Sleep, relax, restore.
