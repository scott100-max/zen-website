Notice three things right now.

...

Anything at all. A colour on the wall. The weight of your hands in your lap. A sound from somewhere you cannot quite place. Three things, without reaching for them.

...

...

Whatever you found just now, that was your attention at work. It is the most versatile instrument you own, and almost nobody learns how to use it.

...

Over the next twenty-one days, you are going to train yours. Not in a vague, abstract way, but with real techniques that have names, that you can practise, and that you can carry with you when this recording ends.

...

Today we begin with the basics. What does your attention actually do when you leave it alone?

...

...

Close your eyes whenever you are ready, and let the outside world grow a little quieter.

...

...

For the next thirty seconds, do not try to concentrate on anything at all. Let your attention roam freely. Your only job is to watch where it goes.

[SILENCE: 30]

...

Notice what happened. Your attention probably visited several places in those thirty seconds. A thought about later today. A sensation in your back. The ambient sounds around you. Perhaps a memory.

...

That is normal. Unguided attention is restless by design. It scans for novelty, for threat, for interest. It has been doing this since you were born, and it is very good at it.

...

...

But here is what makes it trainable. You can choose where to place it, and you can choose to bring it back when it wanders.

...

Let us test that. Pick one sound you can hear right now. Any sound. A hum, a bird, traffic, the air itself. Choose one and hold your attention on it.

...

...

Stay with that sound. When your attention drifts to something else, notice the drift and guide it back. Gently, the way you would redirect a curious child. No scolding.

[SILENCE: 30]

...

...

That moment where you caught the drift and came back, that is the single most important move in all of mindfulness. Everything you will learn in the next three weeks is built on top of that one gesture. Drift, notice, return.

...

...

Now shift your attention to your hands. Do not move them. Just become aware of them from the inside. Notice the temperature in your palms. Notice whether your fingers are tense or loose. Notice any tingling, heaviness, or warmth.

...

...

[SILENCE: 20]

...

Good. Now widen your attention outward again. Let it open like a lens and take in all the sounds around you at once. Not one sound, but the full landscape. Near and far, loud and soft, all of it.

...

...

[SILENCE: 20]

...

One more shift. This time, to the breath. Not to change it, just to watch it do what it already does. The air arriving through your nose. The chest expanding. The quiet turn at the top. And then the slow release.

...

...

...

[SILENCE: 30]

...

What you have just done is move attention between four different anchors. Sound, body, open awareness, breath. You chose where to place it each time, and each time it wandered, you brought it back.

...

Most people spend their entire lives with attention on autopilot. It chases the loudest notification, the most urgent thought, the brightest screen. But it does not have to. You have just proved that.

...

...

That is what you have started building today. And over the next twenty days, you are going to get remarkably good at it.

...

Let your eyes open gently when you are ready, and take a moment to notice the room around you.

...

...

Here is your homework. It takes fifteen seconds. At some point today, stop whatever you are doing and notice three sounds. One nearby, one at a middle distance, one far away. That is it. Fifteen seconds of choosing where your attention goes.

...

You have started something worth finishing. See you tomorrow.
