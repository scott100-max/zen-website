---
Find somewhere comfortable to lie down. A bed, a sofa, even the floor. Whatever works for you right now.
...
Let your arms rest at your sides. Let your legs fall open slightly. If you are comfortable closing your eyes, go ahead and do that now.
...
Take a breath. In through your nose, slow and wide.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out through your mouth. Let everything soften on that exhale.
...
One more. In through your nose, wider and fuller this time.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out. Good. Let your breathing return to its own natural rhythm.
...
......
Here is what we are going to do. We will work through your body, one area at a time. For each one, I will ask you to tense that muscle group, really squeeze it, and hold for a few seconds.
...
Then we release. Your body already knows how to let go. We are just reminding it.
...
Let us start with your feet. Curl your toes and clench them tight. Build the tension through the soles of your feet and into your arches. Squeeze and hold.
...
And release. Let your feet go completely limp. Notice the difference. That wave of softness washing through.
...
Now your lower legs. Point your toes away from you and tighten your calf muscles. Engage them fully and hold.
...
And release. Let your calves go heavy. Let them melt into whatever is beneath you.
...
Move to your thighs. Press your legs together and tighten the front and back of your upper legs. Really squeeze and hold.
...
And release. Let your legs sink down. They are heavy and warm now. Let them rest.
...
......
Take a breath here. In through your nose. Let it come slowly.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out through your mouth. Good. Let your body absorb that breath.
...
Now your hips. Clench those muscles tight. Squeeze and hold them.
...
And release. Notice the tension draining out of your lower body. There is warmth spreading through your legs and hips now. Let it arrive.
...
Move up to your stomach. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Pull them in as though you are bracing for something. Hold it tight.
...
And release. Let your belly go soft. We hold so much tension here without knowing it. Let it all go on this exhale.
...
Now your chest. Breathe in wide and hold it. At the same time, try to squeeze the muscles across your chest. Hold it all.
...
And breathe out. Release everything. Let your chest open and your breathing return to something natural and unhurried.
...
Your hands now. Make fists. Clench them hard, pressing your nails into your palms. Build the tension across your palms, through your fingers, into your wrists. Hold.
...
And open them. Spread your fingers wide for a moment, then let them relax. Let your hands rest, open and loose.
...
Move up to your forearms and biceps. Bend your arms at the elbow and flex. Hold that position and squeeze.
...
And release. Let your arms fall and go heavy. They have done enough today.
...
......
Take another breath. In through your nose, slow and steady.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out through your mouth. Good. Let everything that needs to leave, leave.
...
Now your shoulders. This is a big one. Lift your shoulders up towards your ears. High as they will go. Notice the tension building through your traps and the sides of your neck. Hold it there.
...
And drop them. Just let them fall. Notice how far they drop. That distance is how much tension you were carrying without knowing it.
...
Let your shoulders rest now. Low and heavy and warm.
...
Your neck. Gently press your head back into whatever is supporting it. A firm, steady press. Hold.
...
And release. Let your head rest naturally. Let your neck go loose and comfortable.
...
Now your face. We carry so much here. Clench your jaw, bite down, and squeeze your eyes shut. Scrunch up your whole face, forehead, nose, cheeks. Hold it all tight.
...
And release. Smooth everything out. Let your jaw hang slightly open. Let your forehead go wide and open. Let your cheeks go soft and your tongue rest on the floor of your mouth.
...
......
Take a breath now. In through your nose, unhurried and wide.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out. Your whole body has been tensed and released. Every major muscle group has been given permission to let go.
...
......
Notice how your body is right now. There might be warmth spreading through you. A heaviness. A softness. Whatever you notice, that is right. That is your body in a state of release.
...
......
Imagine that warmth as something you can almost see. A golden glow that starts at your feet. It is sitting there now, warm and comfortable.
...
Let it move slowly up through your calves, through your knees, into your thighs. Travelling at its own unhurried pace.
...
It arrives in your hips. Pools in your lower back. Warming everything it touches.
...
It rises through your stomach. Through your chest. You can notice it in each breath now. Warm air in, calm air out.
...
It spreads through your arms. Down to your fingertips. Your hands are warm and loose.
...
Up through your shoulders. Through your neck. Softening everything it reaches.
...
And it fills your head. Your jaw. Your cheeks. The space behind your eyes. Warm, calm, and quiet.
...
......
Your whole body is resting now. Full of warmth and quiet.
...
......
You have just given your body something it needed. This kind of release, it matters. It is not indulgent. It is maintenance. It is care. And you deserve that.
...
......
When you are ready, and there is no hurry, start to bring some small movements back. Wiggle your fingers and toes. Roll your wrists gently.
...
Take a wider breath now. In through your nose, slow and open.
[SILENCE: 4]
And out. When it suits you, let your eyes open. Slowly. Let the room come back to you at its own pace.
...
You should notice that you are lighter. Softer. More grounded. And if the world is a bit much when you step back into it, remember that this is always here. You can always come back.
...
This has been Salus. Go gently, and take this calm with you.
