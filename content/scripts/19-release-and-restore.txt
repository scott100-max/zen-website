Find somewhere comfortable to lie down. A bed, a sofa, even the floor — whatever works. This session is about releasing what your body has been holding, so we want you as settled as possible.

...

Let your arms rest at your sides. Let your legs fall open slightly. If you're comfortable closing your eyes, go ahead.

...

Take a deep breath in through your nose.

...

And let it out slowly through your mouth.

...

Again. Breathe in, filling your lungs completely.

...

And out. Let everything soften on that exhale.

...

One more. In.

...

And out. Good.

...

Here's what we're going to do. We'll work through your body, one area at a time. For each one, I'll ask you to tense that muscle group — really squeeze it — and hold it for a few seconds. Then we release. And we let the difference between tension and relaxation do the work. Your body already knows how to let go. We're just reminding it.

...

Let's start with your feet.

Curl your toes. Clench them tight. Feel the tension build through the soles of your feet and into your arches. Squeeze.

...

...

And release. Let your feet go completely limp. Feel the difference. That wave of softness. Just notice it.

...

...

Now your lower legs. Point your toes away from you and tighten your calf muscles. Feel them engage. Hold that.

...

...

And release. Let your calves go heavy. Let them melt into whatever's beneath you.

...

...

Move to your thighs. Press your legs together and tighten your quads. Squeeze the front and back of your upper legs. Really hold it.

...

...

And release. Feel your legs sink. They're heavy and warm. Let them be heavy.

...

...

Take a breath here. In through the nose.

...

Out through the mouth.

...

Now your hips and glutes. Clench those muscles. Squeeze. Hold.

...

...

And release. Feel the tension drain out of your lower body. There's a warmth spreading through your legs and hips now. Let it settle.

...

...

Move up to your stomach. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Pull them in like you're bracing for something. Hold it tight.

...

...

And release. Let your belly go soft. We spend so much of the day holding tension here without even knowing it. Let it all go.

...

...

Now your chest. Take a deep breath in and hold it. At the same time, try to squeeze the muscles across your chest. Hold it all.

...

...

And breathe out. Release everything. Let your chest open. Let your breathing become easy and natural again.

...

...

Your hands now. Make fists. Clench them hard. Feel the tension across your palms, through your fingers, into your wrists. Squeeze.

...

...

And open. Spread your fingers wide for a moment. Then let them relax. Let your hands rest, open and loose.

...

...

Move up to your forearms and biceps. Bend your arms at the elbow and flex. Like you're showing off muscles you may or may not have. Hold that.

...

...

And release. Let your arms fall. Let them go heavy. They've done enough today.

...

...

Take another breath. In.

...

And out.

...

Now your shoulders. This is a big one. Lift your shoulders up towards your ears. High as they'll go. Feel the tension build through your traps and the sides of your neck. Hold it there.

...

...

And drop them. Just let them fall. Feel how far they drop. That distance — that's how much tension you were carrying.

...

...

Let your shoulders settle. Let them feel heavy and low and warm.

...

...

Your neck now. Gently press your head back into whatever's supporting it. Feel the tension through the back of your neck. Just a firm, steady press. Hold.

...

...

And release. Let your head rest naturally. Let your neck be easy.

...

...

Now your face. We carry so much here. Start by clenching your jaw. Bite down. Feel the tension through the sides of your face.

...

And release. Let your jaw hang slightly open. Let your tongue rest on the floor of your mouth.

...

Now squeeze your eyes shut. Tight. Scrunch up your whole face — forehead, nose, cheeks. Hold it all.

...

...

And release. Smooth everything out. Let your forehead be wide and open. Let your cheeks go soft. Let the space around your eyes relax.

...

...

Now raise your eyebrows as high as they'll go. Feel the tension across your forehead and scalp. Hold.

...

...

And release. Let everything go. Your entire face is soft and calm.

...

...

Take a deep breath in.

...

And out.

...

Now just lie here for a moment. Your whole body has been tensed and released. Every major muscle group has been given permission to let go.

...

Notice how your body feels. There might be a warmth spreading through you. A heaviness. A softness. Whatever you feel, that's right. That's your body in a state of release.

...

...

Imagine that warmth as something tangible. A warm glow that starts at your feet. It's golden, or amber — whatever colour feels right to you. It's sitting in your feet, and it's warm. Comfortable.

...

Let it move slowly up through your calves. Through your knees. Into your thighs.

...

...

Feel it settle in your hips. Pooling in your lower back. Warming everything.

...

...

It rises through your stomach. Through your chest. You can feel it in each breath now — warm air in, calm air out.

...

...

It spreads through your arms. Down to your fingertips. Your hands feel warm and loose.

...

...

Up through your shoulders. Through your neck. It softens everything it touches.

...

...

And it fills your head. Your jaw. Your cheeks. The space behind your eyes. Warm and calm and still.

...

...

Your whole body is resting now. Full of this warmth. Full of this quiet.

...

...

...

Stay here for a moment. There's no rush.

...

...

...

You've just given your body something it needed. This kind of release — it matters. It's not indulgent. It's maintenance. It's care. And you deserve that.

...

...

When you're ready — and there's no hurry — start to bring some small movements back. Wiggle your fingers and toes. Roll your wrists gently.

...

Take a deeper breath.

...

And when it feels right, let your eyes open. Slowly. Let the room come back to you at its own pace.

...

You should feel lighter. Softer. More settled. And if the world feels a bit much when you step back into it, remember — this is always here. You can always come back.

...

This has been Salus. Go gently.
