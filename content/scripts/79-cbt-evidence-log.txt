Expected-Repetitions: what is the evidence

Welcome to The Evidence Log, a restructuring exercise.
...
This session uses a technique called cognitive restructuring. It is one of the most tested and reliable methods in all of psychology.
...
The idea is straightforward. When a thought causes you distress, you examine the evidence for and against it, the same way a scientist would test a hypothesis. Not to dismiss the thought, but to see it more clearly.
......
Begin by allowing your body to arrive where it is. You do not need to sit any particular way. Just let yourself land.
...
Close your eyes or lower your gaze, and take two or three breaths at your own pace. Let each exhale carry a little more tension out of your shoulders, your jaw, your hands.
......
Now bring to mind a thought that has been bothering you recently. Not the most painful thing in your life, just something that has been circling. A worry, a self-criticism, a nagging doubt. Something that tightens your chest a little when it arrives.
...
You do not need to say this thought out loud. Just hold it gently in your awareness, as if you were reading it written on a piece of paper in front of you.
......
Notice how this thought makes you respond. Does your stomach tighten? Do your shoulders lift? Does your breathing become a little shorter? Just observe what happens in your body when this thought is present.
...
That physical response is real. The thought may or may not be accurate, but the distress it causes is genuine. We are not here to invalidate that.
......
Now imagine placing that thought on a table in front of you. It is no longer inside your head. It is outside, on the table, where you can look at it with some distance.
...
We are going to examine this thought the way a careful researcher would examine a claim. Not with hostility, not trying to disprove it. Just with honest curiosity about whether it holds up under scrutiny.
......
The first question. What is the evidence that supports this thought? What facts, not opinions, but actual observable facts, suggest that this thought might be true?
...
Take a moment to consider this. If this thought were a claim in a report, what data would you include to support it?
[SILENCE: 30s]
Notice what came to mind. Some of that evidence may be solid. Some of it may be based on assumptions, on mind-reading, on predicting the future. That is normal. Just notice the difference between hard evidence and interpretation.
......
Now the second question. What is the evidence against this thought? What facts suggest it might not be entirely accurate?
...
This is often harder because distressing thoughts tend to filter out contradictory evidence. They present themselves as airtight cases with no room for doubt. Your job right now is to look for the doubt.
...
Has there been a time when this thought was proven wrong? Has someone you trust offered a different perspective? Are there facts you have been overlooking because they do not fit the narrative?
[SILENCE: 30s]
You may have found more counter-evidence than you expected. Or you may have found very little. Both are fine. This is not about winning an argument against yourself.
......
Now a third question, and this one matters most. Imagine someone you care about told you they were carrying this exact thought. How would you respond to them?
...
Most of us are far more balanced and compassionate when evaluating someone else's distressing thoughts than our own. We can see the full picture for others in a way we cannot for ourselves.
...
Take a moment to imagine that conversation. What would you say? What evidence would you point to? What would you gently challenge?
[SILENCE: 20s]
Whatever you would say to that friend is worth saying to yourself. Not because your thought is wrong, but because you deserve the same honest, balanced perspective that you would offer anyone you care about.
......
Now return to the thought on the table. Having examined the evidence on both sides, ask yourself this. Is there a more balanced version of this thought? Not a positive version, not a dismissal, but a version that accounts for all the evidence?
...
The original thought was probably extreme in some way. Most distressing thoughts are. They use words like always, never, everyone, no one. A balanced thought is more specific, more accurate, and more fair.
...
Sit with that balanced version for a moment. Notice how it lands differently in your body compared to the original.
......
This exercise is not about replacing negative thoughts with positive ones. It is about replacing distorted thoughts with accurate ones. Sometimes the accurate version is still uncomfortable, but it is almost always more manageable than the distortion.
...
The more you practise this, the faster it becomes. Eventually, you will catch distorted thoughts in the moment and run through the evidence without needing a guided session. That is the goal.
......
For now, let the thought on the table dissolve. You have examined it thoroughly. It does not need any more of your attention right now.
...
Bring your awareness back to the room around you. Notice the temperature of the air, the weight of your body, any sounds in the background.
...
Open your eyes whenever you are ready, and carry that balanced perspective with you into the rest of your day.
...
Thank you for working through this exercise with me today.
