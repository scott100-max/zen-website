Listen to the room around you for a moment or two.
...
Before we begin, notice whatever sounds are present. The hum of a radiator, traffic in the distance, the creak of the building around you. None of these sounds are a problem. They are just the texture of your evening.
...
Tonight I am going to guide you through a technique called the cognitive shuffle. It was developed by a cognitive scientist named Luc Beaudoin, and it is based on a specific observation about how your brain falls asleep.
...
When you are lying in bed trying to rest, your mind often produces structured, coherent thoughts. Plans for tomorrow. Replays of the day. Worries that loop back on themselves.
...
This kind of thinking is a signal to your brain that you are still engaged with the world, still problem-solving, still alert. It keeps you awake because it is exactly the kind of processing your brain does when it needs to stay sharp.
...
The cognitive shuffle interrupts that pattern. Instead of coherent thoughts, you deliberately produce random, unrelated images, one after another, in no particular order. Your brain interprets this scattered, purposeless mental activity as the kind of thing that happens naturally just before you fall asleep. And in doing so, it begins the transition into rest.
......
Here is how it works. I am going to give you a word, and then count down slowly from ten. With each number, I want you to picture a different object or scene that starts with the same letter as that word. The images do not need to connect to each other. In fact, the less they connect, the better.
...
Do not try to be clever or creative. If nothing comes to mind for a particular number, just let that one pass and wait for the next. There is no way to do this wrong.
......
Let your body settle into a position you could hold for the rest of the night. Let your jaw unclench. Let the weight of your head press fully into the pillow.
...
Inhale slowly through your nose. And release the air through your mouth, letting your shoulders drop as you do.
......
Your first letter is S. Let the images come slowly.
...
Ten. Picture something that begins with S. It could be a strawberry, a sailboat, a sandcastle, a staircase. Whatever arrives first in your mind, hold it there for a moment and then let it dissolve.
......
Nine. A new image, still beginning with S. Something completely unrelated to the first. Let it form, hold it gently, and let it go.
......
Eight. Another image. If your mind drifts to something that begins with a different letter, that is fine. Let it come. The goal is scattered images, not alphabetical discipline.
......
Seven. A new picture. Notice how the images arrive more slowly as you relax. That is exactly what is supposed to happen.
......
Six. Let the next image form on its own. Do not reach for it. Just wait and see what your mind offers up.
......
Five. You are halfway through this round. Your breathing has probably slowed without you noticing. Good. Let the next image appear.
......
Four. If your images are becoming blurry or hard to hold, that is a very good sign. Your visual cortex is beginning to behave the way it does in the moments before rest arrives.
......
Three. One more image. Let it be soft around the edges. Let it drift.
......
Two. Almost there. Notice how heavy your eyelids have become. Let the image be faint.
......
One. Let the last picture dissolve. Let the letter go entirely.
......
Now we will try another letter. This time, the letter is R.
...
Ten. Picture something beginning with R. Let it appear slowly. A river, a robin, a rowing boat, a rooftop. Whatever comes.
......
Nine. A new image. Let each one arrive at its own pace. There is no rush.
......
Eight. Notice the gaps between images growing longer. Your mind is slowing down. That is the shuffle working exactly as it should.
......
Seven. Another image. Hold it loosely, the way you might hold a soap bubble.
......
Six. If you are still awake, that is fine. The technique builds gradually. Let the next image come when it is ready.
......
Five. Halfway again. Each round takes you a little further from the alert, problem-solving mind and a little closer to the quiet, drifting mind that precedes rest.
......
Four. A new image. Softer now. Let it be incomplete if it wants to be.
......
Three. Nearly there. Your body is doing its own work now, following the signals your mind is sending.
......
Two. One more image now. Barely formed. Barely held.
......
One. Let it go. Let the letter dissolve along with it.
......
If you are still listening, there is no need to start another round. Your mind knows what to do from here. Random images, unconnected, purposeless, drifting one into the next without any thread to hold them together.
...
Let them come on their own now. You do not need my voice to guide them. Your brain will produce them naturally, the way it does every night in the moments you never remember because you were already gone.
......
Let the images blur. Let them overlap. Let them stop making sense.
...
There is nothing left that needs your attention tonight. The day is finished and the morning will arrive on its own.
......
The night is yours now. Rest well. Goodnight from Salus.
