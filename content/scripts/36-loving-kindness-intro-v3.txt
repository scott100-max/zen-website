Find a comfortable position, wherever you are right now, and gently allow your eyes to close.
...
There is nowhere you need to go. Nothing that needs your attention in this moment.
...
Let your shoulders drop away from your ears, and soften the muscles around your jaw and forehead.
...
Take a slow, long breath in through your nose, letting your chest open wide, and let it go.
...
And one more breath, a little longer this time. Notice your whole body growing quiet and calm as you exhale.
...
Today we are going to explore a practice called loving-kindness. It is one of the oldest meditation traditions in the world, and it works in a beautifully plain way. We quietly offer kind wishes, first to ourselves, and then gradually outward to the people around us.
...
There is nothing to force here. No emotion you need to create. Just offer the words like seeds planted in open ground, and trust that something will grow in its own time.
...
Rest one hand gently over your heart, if that is comfortable. Notice the warmth of your palm there, and the quiet rhythm beneath it. This is your anchor for the practice ahead.
...
Now bring your attention inward, towards yourself, with the same care you would show a close friend who needed comfort. We often find it easier to send kindness to others than to ourselves, so this first step may seem new. That is perfectly normal.
...
In your own mind, begin to repeat these words directed towards yourself. May I live safe and protected from harm.
...
...
May I know happiness and contentment, just as I am in this moment.
...
May I grow strong and well in body and in mind.
...
May I carry a sense of ease and deep, abiding calm through my days.
...
There is no need to judge whatever arises. If the words seem distant, let them remain distant. If emotion comes, let it come and go. Keep offering the phrases, gently, without expecting anything in return.
...
...
I am going to be quiet now for a short while. Stay with this warmth directed towards yourself, and let the sounds around you hold the space.
...
...
...
...
Now, gently turn your attention outward, towards someone you care about. A partner, a parent, a close friend. Picture their face, the way they look when they are laughing.
...
Silently wish for them what you wished for yourself. That they might walk through their days unharmed. That they might know real happiness. That their body and mind stay well. That their life holds a steady, quiet calm.
...
...
Now bring to mind someone you see regularly but do not know well. Perhaps a neighbour, or someone you pass on your way to work each morning. You may not know their name, but just like you, they long to live without fear and to know that they are cared for.
...
Extend those same good wishes towards them now. Picture the warmth moving from your heart to theirs, carrying with it the hope that their life holds comfort and meaning.
...
And now, if you are willing, bring to mind someone who has caused you some difficulty recently. Not the hardest person in your life, just someone with whom things have run a little rough.
...
Remember that offering kindness does not mean you approve of their actions. It means recognising that they, too, are a person who knows pain. If it is possible, see if you can hold them in this same warm light, even for a moment.
...
...
Now let your awareness expand as wide as you can imagine. Your street, your town, your country, and gradually the whole world. Thousands of millions of people, each one carrying their own hopes and their own sorrows.
...
May all beings, everywhere, walk through their lives in safety and in good health. May every living creature know some measure of happiness, and may every heart find its way to calm.
...
Picture that warmth moving outward from your heart, like ripples spreading across still water. There is no limit to how far kindness can travel.
...
Gently let go of the phrases and the images now. Let everything grow quiet, and notice how you are, without needing to name it or explain it.
...
Begin to bring your awareness back to your breath. The gentle rise and fall of your chest. The sounds around you. The weight of your body against what is beneath you.
...
When you are ready, in your own time, gently open your eyes. Carry whatever warmth you have found here with you into the rest of your day.
