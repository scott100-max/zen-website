Welcome to Salus.

So you're angry. Or frustrated. Or something in that neighbourhood. Good. I'm glad you're here instead of somewhere else right now. That took something.

...

Here's what we're not going to do: we're not going to pretend the anger isn't there. We're not going to talk you out of it or tell you to calm down. That never works. You know that. I know that.

...

What we are going to do is give it some room. Let it breathe. And then — when it's ready, not before — let it go.

...

Sit down if you can. Plant your feet on the floor. Feel the ground beneath you. You need something solid right now, and the floor isn't going anywhere.

...

...

Let's start with your breath. And I know — when you're angry, being told to breathe feels patronising. But stay with me. This isn't about pretending to be calm. This is about physiology. Your heart rate is up. Your muscles are tight. Your system is running hot. And the breath is the fastest way to turn the temperature down.

...

We're going to do a specific pattern. In through the nose for four. Out through the mouth for eight. That long exhale is the key. It's a direct signal to your nervous system to stand down. It works even when you don't want it to.

...

Here we go. In... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

...

Again. In... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

...

One more. In... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

...

...

OK. You might already notice a slight shift. Maybe not. Either way, we keep going.

...

Now I want you to notice where the anger lives in your body. Don't think about it — feel it. Where is it sitting?

...

Is it in your chest? A tight, hot feeling behind your sternum?

...

Is it in your hands? Are they clenched? Are they vibrating with the need to do something?

...

Is it in your jaw? Teeth grinding, muscles locked?

...

Is it in your stomach? A churning, burning feeling?

...

...

Wherever it is, put your attention there. Right on it. Don't flinch. Don't turn away. Just look at it, in the way that only you can — from the inside.

...

...

What does it feel like? If you had to describe it without using emotion words — just physical sensations — what would you say? Hot? Tight? Pulsing? Sharp? Heavy?

...

...

Stay with it. This is important. When we actually look at anger — really look at it — something interesting happens. It starts to shift. Not because we're forcing it. But because awareness changes things. Observation changes things.

...

...

...

Now here's a picture I want you to hold. Imagine the anger as heat. Physical heat. Like a furnace running in your chest, or a fire in your belly. It's real, and it's hot, and it's been burning hard.

...

Now imagine that with each exhale — each long, slow exhale — you're venting some of that heat. Like opening a valve. The fire doesn't go out all at once. But the pressure drops. The temperature comes down, degree by degree.

...

Let's breathe with that image.

In... two... three... four.

...

And out — feel the heat leaving. Two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

...

...

In... two... three... four.

...

Out — more heat escaping, more pressure releasing. Two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

...

...

In... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

...

...

...

The temperature is dropping. You can feel it. The sharp edge of the anger is softening. It's not gone — and it doesn't need to be — but it's less in control now. You're more in control.

...

...

Now I want you to unclench. Physically. Starting with your hands. If they're in fists, open them. Spread your fingers wide. Then let them relax. Let your hands be loose and open.

...

Your jaw. Unclench it. Let your mouth hang open slightly. Let your tongue drop from the roof of your mouth.

...

Your shoulders. They've been up around your ears. Let them fall. Feel them drop.

...

Your stomach. If it's been tight, let it go soft. Even just a little.

...

...

...

Take a normal breath. Easy and natural.

...

...

Now here's the thing about anger. It always has something underneath it. Always. Sometimes it's hurt. Sometimes it's fear. Sometimes it's a boundary that was crossed. Sometimes it's just exhaustion wearing a different mask.

...

You don't have to figure that out right now. But I want you to know that the anger is valid. Whatever caused it — it's valid. You're allowed to feel it. You're allowed to be human about it.

...

What you've done here — choosing to pause instead of react — that's not weakness. That's the strongest thing a person can do when the fire is running. It's the hardest choice and the best one.

...

...

...

Let's do a final set of breaths. Slow and easy.

In... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

...

In... two... three... four.

...

Out... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

...

...

...

The fire has died down. There might still be embers. That's fine. Embers are manageable. Embers don't burn the house down.

...

...

Feel your feet on the floor. Feel the solidity of the ground. You're here. You're steady. You're in control.

...

When you're ready, open your eyes. Take a moment before you do anything else. Get a glass of water if you can. Water helps more than people think.

...

And when you step back into things — whatever triggered this — you'll do it from a cooler place. A clearer place. The anger gave you information. Now you get to decide what to do with it.

...

This has been Salus. You handled that well.
