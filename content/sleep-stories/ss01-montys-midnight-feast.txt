Settle in tonight. Get comfortable.

...

Pull the covers up. Let your body find the position it wants.

...

The one where everything is supported. Where nothing is strained.

...

Close your eyes whenever you're ready.

...

...

Tonight, I'm going to tell you a story. A quiet little story about a cat called Monty.

...

Monty is a ginger tabby. A big one. The kind of cat who takes up more of the sofa than seems fair, and who somehow manages to look both dignified and slightly ridiculous at the same time.

...

He's got copper-coloured fur that catches the light, and enormous golden eyes, and paws the size of small biscuits. His whiskers are long and white and slightly crooked on the left side, from an incident with a butterfly that he'd rather not discuss.

...

...

He lives in a cottage. A proper old cottage, in the countryside, with thick stone walls and low ceilings and a front door that sticks in winter. The kind of cottage that has been settling into the earth for two hundred years and shows no sign of stopping.

...

The walls are whitewashed inside, except in the sitting room, where they've been painted a deep, warm cream that has darkened with age and woodsmoke to the colour of old parchment. The floors are flagstone downstairs and wide oak boards upstairs. There are rugs everywhere, thick and faded and warm, because the flagstones get cold at night and Monty has standards.

...

The ceilings are low. Low enough that the beams, dark and rough and original, are close enough to touch if you stand on your toes. They've been there since the cottage was built, and they've been carrying the weight of the upstairs rooms with quiet, uncomplaining strength ever since.

...

...

It's winter now. Late January. Outside, the countryside is dark and still. The fields stretch away under a full moon, silver and frozen, hedgerows marking the boundaries like dark stitching on a pale quilt.

...

The air outside is sharp. The kind of cold that makes your breath visible and your nose tingle. But inside the cottage, everything is warm.

...

...

The fire in the sitting room has been burning all evening. Logs of apple wood, split and stacked in the basket beside the hearth. Apple wood burns slowly and sweetly, and it fills the cottage with a faint scent of orchards even in the dead of winter.

...

Now the fire has burned down to embers. Orange coals glowing behind the grate, pulsing gently, throwing a faint amber light across the flagstone floor. Every now and then, a coal shifts and settles, and a tiny cascade of sparks rises up the chimney like miniature fireworks.

...

...

The old clock on the mantelpiece ticks. Steady and reliable. The same tick it's been ticking for decades. A sound so familiar it's become part of the silence itself. You don't hear it unless you listen for it. And then, once you notice it, it becomes the most comforting sound in the world.

...

Tick. Tick. Tick.

...

Measuring out the quiet hours of the night in small, patient intervals.

...

...

Everyone in the cottage is asleep. The house has settled. The radiators have stopped clicking. The pipes have stopped their quiet singing. The fridge in the kitchen has paused its low hum.

...

It's just the clock now. And the embers. And the enormous ginger cat on the armchair.

...

...

Monty has been sleeping on the armchair by the fire since half past nine. It's his armchair, really. It's an old wing-back chair, upholstered in green velvet that has faded to the colour of sage. The seat cushion has a permanent Monty-shaped depression in it, worn smooth by years of nightly occupation.

...

He's curled into a tight ginger circle, nose tucked under his tail, one paw covering his eyes. His breathing is slow and deep. His sides rise and fall with the gentle rhythm of a cat who is completely, unreservedly at peace with the world.

...

...

But something has woken him. Not a noise, exactly. More like a feeling. A gentle tug somewhere behind his whiskers that says the same thing it says every night around this time.

...

It says: the kitchen.

...

It says: the plate beside the toaster.

...

It says: it's time for the midnight feast.

...

...

He opens one eye first. Just one. The golden iris catches the ember-light and glows like a tiny lantern. He doesn't move anything else. Just that one eye, scanning the room from beneath the shelter of his own tail.

...

He listens. Assesses. The house is still. Good.

...

The other eye opens. He lifts his head from the warm nest of his own body and blinks slowly, twice. Those long, deliberate cat blinks that mean something is being considered.

...

...

Then he stretches. That particular cat stretch that looks like it feels absolutely wonderful. The stretch that makes you think being a cat might actually be the finest thing in the world.

...

Front paws out first, way out in front, claws spreading and retracting against the velvet. His back arches. His whole body trembles with the effort and the pleasure of it. Every muscle engaged, every sinew pulled taut, and then released.

...

Then the back legs extend, one at a time, pushed out behind him, toes spreading. A full-body yawn follows. Enormous. His mouth opens so wide you can see every tooth, and then it closes, and he licks his lips once, and he is ready.

...

...

He steps down from the armchair with the careful dignity of someone who has done this a thousand times and intends to do it a thousand more.

...

His paws touch the flagstone floor. Cool stone after the warmth of the chair. He pauses for a moment, adjusting to the temperature. Then he begins to walk.

...

...

...

There's something beautiful about the way a cat moves through a dark house at night. No hurry. No noise. Just soft paws on cool stone, and the faintest swish of a tail held low and steady.

...

Monty crosses the sitting room. Past the sofa with its rumpled cushions, where someone fell asleep reading earlier and left the book face-down on the armrest. Past the bookcase stuffed with old paperbacks, their spines faded and cracked. Past the basket of logs beside the fire, where a spider has built an ambitious web between two pieces of birch.

...

...

He passes the side table with the reading lamp and the half-drunk cup of tea that someone forgot to take to the kitchen. He passes the photograph on the wall, the one in the silver frame, where two people are laughing on a beach somewhere warm. He doesn't look at it. He passes it every night. It's just part of the geography now.

...

...

The doorway to the hall is open. He slips through without breaking stride, his body lengthening momentarily as he passes through the narrow gap between door and frame.

...

The hallway is darker than the sitting room. No embers here, no residual warmth from the fire. Just the thin blue light of a winter moon coming through the glass panel above the front door.

...

It paints a long pale rectangle on the tile floor, and Monty walks straight through it. His shadow, for a moment, stretches out behind him like a small dark ghost. And then he's past it, back into the gloom, moving steadily towards the kitchen.

...

...

The hallway smells different from the sitting room. Less smoke, more stone. There's a coat rack on the wall with jackets and scarves piled up, and Wellington boots lined up beneath it, and the whole area carries the faint, not-unpleasant smell of outdoor clothes and damp wool.

...

Monty weaves between the boots without touching them. He has navigated this hallway in the dark more times than he can count. Every obstacle is mapped in his mind. Every floorboard that creaks, every rug that bunches, every shoe left carelessly in the middle of the path.

...

...

He passes the bottom of the stairs. Pauses. Listens.

...

From up above, the faintest sound of breathing. Slow and deep and steady. The sound of someone very far away in sleep, dreaming about things that have nothing to do with ginger cats and midnight feasts.

...

Monty's ears rotate once, independently of each other, like tiny satellite dishes receiving transmissions from different corners of the house. One ear points upstairs. The other points towards the kitchen. Both report the same thing: all clear.

...

Satisfied, he moves on.

...

...

...

The kitchen is at the end of the hall. The door is ajar, because someone always leaves it ajar. They've been doing it for years. Monty doesn't know if they do it on purpose or by habit, and he doesn't care. He has counted on this door being open his entire life, and it has never let him down.

...

He nudges it with his nose and it swings open silently. He steps inside.

...

...

The kitchen is Monty's favourite room in the house, and at midnight, it belongs entirely to him.

...

It's a large kitchen, by cottage standards. Fitted out in a way that's half modern and half falling apart. Old wooden cupboards with brass handles that have turned green with age. A slate worktop that's been there since the house was built. A gas cooker that looks like it came from the nineteen seventies, because it did.

...

...

The moonlight is stronger here. A big window over the sink lets it pour in, silver and blue, turning the ordinary kitchen into something enchanted. The copper pans hanging from the rack above the stove gleam like treasure. The glass jars on the shelf, full of flour and sugar and dried pasta, glow faintly from within.

...

...

The old wooden table in the middle of the room is large and scarred and beautiful. Ring marks from a hundred mugs of tea. A groove where someone once cut bread without a board. A smooth, pale patch where generations of elbows have rested. The mismatched chairs are pushed in around it, each one a slightly different height and style, as though they've been collected one by one over the course of decades.

...

...

Everything is still. Everything is gleaming faintly in the blue light. The tap drips once, catching the moonlight as it falls. A single silver bead, dropping into the darkness of the sink.

...

...

And there, on the worktop beside the toaster, is exactly what Monty knew would be there.

...

A plate. A small plate with a blue rim and a tiny chip on one edge where it was dropped three Christmases ago. And on it, two pieces of cold roast chicken, left out from dinner.

...

They weren't left out by accident. They're Monty's. Everyone knows it. Nobody says it. It's an arrangement that works perfectly for everyone involved, and has done for years.

...

...

Now, Monty is a dignified cat. He doesn't rush. He doesn't scramble or leap. He has never, in his life, knocked anything off a worktop. He considers this a point of considerable personal pride.

...

He simply hops up onto the kitchen chair. The one with the blue cushion. Then from the chair to the table. Then from the table, a careful step across to the worktop. The slate is cool under his paws.

...

Three elegant movements. Practised. Precise. Like a dancer executing a routine he could do in his sleep.

...

...

He sniffs the chicken. Once. Twice. His whiskers twitch forward, spread wide, reading the air. Assessing. Not because he doubts the chicken, but because this is part of the ritual, and rituals matter.

...

Then he eats. Slowly and deliberately. Taking small, careful bites, as though this were a meal at a fine restaurant and not a stolen snack at midnight in a dark kitchen.

...

...

The chicken is good. Cold and tender and faintly salty, with a crisp edge of skin that he saves for last because it's the best bit. Monty chews with quiet satisfaction, his eyes half-closed, his purr starting up faintly somewhere deep in his throat.

...

He eats the way cats eat when there's no competition. No gulping. No guarding. Just small, careful, deliberate mouthfuls, each one savoured. His jaw works with a quiet clicking rhythm, and every few bites he pauses, licks his lips, and looks around the kitchen as though making sure the world is still in order before continuing.

...

...

Outside, the moon hangs full and white above the fields. The garden is silver and shadow. The bird table on the lawn stands like a tiny watchtower, its roof dusted with frost. Nothing moves except a barn owl, gliding silently over the hedge at the bottom of the lane, hunting for mice in the frozen stubble.

...

...

Monty takes his time with the second piece of chicken. There is no rushing a midnight feast. That's the whole point of it. The house is asleep. The world is asleep. And here, in this moonlit kitchen, a ginger cat is having a quiet and perfect meal, and nobody knows except him and the moon.

...

...

...

He finishes the last bite. Licks his lips. Then licks the plate, once, twice, with a small rough tongue, chasing the last traces of flavour from the blue-rimmed china.

...

And now begins the second part of the ritual. The wash.

...

...

He sits back on his haunches on the worktop, tucks his tail around his paws, and lifts his right front paw to his mouth.

...

Lick. Lick. Lick.

...

Then the paw goes over the ear. Smoothing it back. Cleaning it. Getting behind it, where the fur is thinnest and the skin is warmest.

...

...

He switches to the left paw. Same process. Lick, lick, lick, then over the ear. Slow and thorough and deeply satisfying. This is not vanity. This is maintenance. This is a cat putting himself back in order after the excitement of the feast.

...

The whiskers come next. Smoothed back carefully on each side with alternating paws. Left side, then right side. They spring back into position, perfectly arranged, slightly crooked on the left as always.

...

...

Then the chest. He dips his head and works through the fur with long, deliberate strokes of his tongue. The moonlight catches the wet fur and makes it gleam.

...

...

...

When he's satisfied, and not a moment before, he sits up straight and looks out of the window.

...

The garden is beautiful at night. More beautiful, Monty thinks, than it is during the day, when there are people in it making noise and hanging washing on the line and pulling things out of the ground for no reason he can understand.

...

At night, the garden is his.

...

...

The lawn is silver. Every blade of grass carries a bead of frost, and the whole lawn shimmers faintly, like a lake seen from very far away. The apple tree at the far end throws a web of black branches against the pale sky. The stone bird bath catches the moonlight and holds it like a bowl of liquid silver.

...

...

A fox crosses the bottom of the garden. Monty sees it immediately. His ears prick forward and his body goes absolutely still, every muscle locked in that particular cat pose that looks like a statue carved from living fur.

...

The fox is a dark shape, low and quick, slipping through the gap in the hedge where the wire has come loose. It's a vixen, Monty thinks. Smaller than the dog fox that sometimes appears in autumn. She pauses for a moment on the lawn, right beside the bird bath, and Monty can see her breath, two small plumes of vapour rising in the cold air. Her ears twitch. Her nose reads the garden.

...

Then she's gone, melted back into the hedgerow as silently as she arrived, off about her own midnight business in the frozen fields beyond.

...

Monty watches the space where the fox was for a long time. Not because he's worried. Just because watching is what he does. He is the nightwatchman of this cottage, and he takes his responsibilities seriously.

...

...

A leaf blows across the lawn. He tracks it with his eyes but doesn't move. Not tonight. Tonight is for watching, not chasing. Tonight is for stillness and chicken and moonlight and the quiet satisfaction of being the only creature awake in a sleeping house.

...

...

...

The world outside is cold and still and deeply peaceful. Frost is forming on everything now. The garden gate. The fence posts. The handle of the wheelbarrow left out by the shed. Every surface is being slowly, silently coated in a thin skin of ice, and the whole garden glitters under the moon like something made of glass.

...

...

Monty turns away from the window. The view has been noted. The kingdom is in order. The fox has passed through and moved on. The owl is hunting elsewhere. All is well.

...

He hops down from the worktop to the table. From the table to the chair. From the chair to the floor. Three movements in reverse. Just as elegant. Just as quiet.

...

...

He walks to the corner of the kitchen where his water bowl sits on a small rubber mat. The mat is there because Monty has a habit of splashing when he drinks, and the flagstones get slippery, and there was an incident once that he would also prefer not to discuss.

...

The water is still and clear and cold. He lowers his face to it and drinks. Tiny, delicate laps, barely disturbing the surface. Each one produces a miniature ripple that expands outward and bounces off the rim of the bowl and returns to the centre, where it meets the next ripple going out.

...

...

His reflection looks back at him from the water. A round ginger face with golden eyes and white whiskers and an expression of total contentment. A very handsome cat, if he does say so himself. And he does.

...

...

...

The drink finished, Monty begins the long journey back through the cottage.

...

He takes a slightly different route this time. He goes through the utility room first. It's a small room off the kitchen, barely big enough for the washing machine and the tumble dryer and the shelf where the cleaning products live.

...

But it has a radiator. A low, wide radiator under the window, and even though the heating went off hours ago, the metal still holds a ghost of warmth. Monty presses his side against it and stands there for a moment, eyes half-closed, absorbing the last residual heat through his fur.

...

...

The utility room has a cat flap in the back door. Monty looks at it. The garden is right there. The cold, crisp, moonlit garden, full of interesting smells and frozen grass and the lingering trace of the fox.

...

He considers it for approximately one and a half seconds.

...

No. Not tonight. He's done it before, of course. Slipped out through the cat flap on summer nights and spent hours in the garden, stalking moths and sitting on the warm paving stones and watching the bats wheel and dive above the apple tree.

...

But that was summer. This is January. And the feast has been eaten. The wash has been done. The water has been drunk. There is only one thing left on the agenda, and it's upstairs.

...

...

...

He pads back through the kitchen, past the table, past the empty plate on the worktop, past the tap that drips again into the dark sink. Through the kitchen door, left ajar. Along the dark hallway with its strip of moonlight on the tiles and its smell of coats and boot leather.

...

...

He pauses at the foot of the stairs again. Listens. The breathing from above is unchanged. Slow and deep and completely unaware of his midnight adventure. The clock in the sitting room ticks on, marking the seconds with quiet precision.

...

...

He considers the stairs. Fourteen of them. Carpeted in deep burgundy, worn thin in the middle from years of footsteps. He knows every one of them. He knows which ones creak and which ones don't. He knows that the third one is silent, and the seventh one groans if you step on the left side, and the eleventh one is the worst of the lot and should be avoided at all costs.

...

He takes the first step. Then the second. Unhurried. One paw placed carefully in front of the other, each one landing precisely in the centre of the stair where the carpet is thickest and the sound is least.

...

...

Third step. Silent, as expected. Fourth. Fifth. Sixth. Each one a small, deliberate act of stealth. He is a cat on a mission. He is a cat who takes the stairs seriously.

...

Seventh step. He places his paw on the right side, well away from the danger zone on the left. The stair accepts his weight without complaint.

...

...

Eighth. Ninth. Tenth. The landing is coming into view now. He can see the upstairs hallway, dimly lit by the moonlight coming through the bathroom window. The bathroom door is always open. It's another of those arrangements.

...

...

Eleventh step. The bad one. He pauses, shifts his weight, and steps over it entirely, reaching up to the twelfth step in one long, fluid movement. His back paw lifts off the tenth step and lands on the twelfth without the eleventh ever knowing he was there.

...

Thirteenth. A small creak, barely audible. Monty freezes. Waits. Counts three ticks of the clock downstairs. Nothing stirs. He continues.

...

Fourteenth. He's at the top. All four paws on the landing carpet. Mission accomplished. Fourteen stairs, navigated in perfect silence, give or take one minor creak that nobody heard.

...

...

...

The landing is warm and carpeted and smells faintly of lavender from the dried bunch hanging on the bedroom door handle. There's a small table up here with a lamp and a stack of books and a photograph of a dog who lived here before Monty did. Monty has never acknowledged the photograph. He walks past it every night as though it doesn't exist, which, as far as he is concerned, it doesn't.

...

...

The bathroom door is open, and moonlight streams out of it in a wide silver beam. Monty walks through the beam and his fur turns white for a moment, then ginger again as he passes into shadow.

...

The bedroom door is open. Just enough for a large ginger cat to slip through without touching the frame. He's measured this gap with his whiskers a hundred times. It's always exactly right.

...

He enters silently.

...

...

The bedroom is the warmest room in the house. Soft and dark and full of the gentle sounds of sleep. Breathing, mostly. Two people breathing, slightly out of sync with each other, creating a pattern that is irregular and soothing at the same time.

...

...

The curtains are half-drawn. A slice of moonlight falls across the foot of the bed, painting a bright stripe across the duvet. It catches the edge of a folded blanket and the corner of a pillow that has migrated to the wrong end of the bed during the night.

...

The room smells of sleep. That warm, particular, human smell that Monty associates with the end of every day and the beginning of every night. Warm skin and cotton and the faintest trace of the hand cream that lives on the bedside table. It smells like home. It smells like the place he is always heading towards, no matter how far the midnight feast takes him.

...

There's a glass of water on the bedside table, half-full, catching the moonlight. A phone face-down, its screen dark. A paperback, open at a page that will never be finished tonight. The small, ordinary evidence of a life paused for sleep.

...

...

The bed is big and old and slightly sagging in the middle. An antique frame, iron and brass, with a mattress that's been turned and flipped and turned again so many times that it's developed a topography of its own. Valleys and ridges and one very comfortable dip on the left side where someone has slept for so many years that the springs have given up and formed a permanent hollow.

...

...

Monty jumps up. One fluid leap from the floor to the foot of the bed, landing so softly that the sleepers don't stir. He weighs nearly six kilos and yet he lands with less impact than a dropped handkerchief.

...

He stands for a moment on the duvet, feeling the warmth rising from the bodies beneath. It's like standing on a warm cloud. The duvet is thick and white and slightly rumpled, and his paws sink into it with each step.

...

...

Then he walks. Slowly. Up the length of the bed, between the two sleeping figures, placing his paws with extraordinary care. He does not step on anyone. He does not nudge anyone. He is a ghost made of ginger fur and good manners.

...

He's done this so many times that he knows the landscape of this bed like a map. The dip on the left side. The ridge in the middle where the mattress humps up between the two sleepers. The warm valley on the right, where the extra pillow has been pushed aside.

...

...

...

He finds his spot. The one he always chooses. The one that has been his since the first night he slept in this house, when he was a kitten small enough to fit in one hand and he climbed up onto this bed and found this exact spot and decided, with the absolute certainty that only cats possess, that this was where he belonged.

...

Right between the pillows. Where the warmth gathers and the breathing is closest and the duvet forms a natural nest that seems designed specifically for a cat of his dimensions.

...

...

He circles once. Twice. Three times. Patting the duvet down with his paws, kneading it gently, making his nest. This is an ancient behaviour. A ritual older than cottages and kitchen worktops and blue-rimmed plates. Cats have been doing this since the beginning of cats, turning three times before lying down, and no one has ever satisfactorily explained why.

...

Monty doesn't need an explanation. He just does it because it feels right.

...

...

Then he folds himself down. Front legs first, tucking neatly underneath his chest. Then the back end, curling around so his tail wraps over his nose. His eyes close and open and close again. Slowly. Heavily.

...

A perfect ginger circle on the white duvet.

...

...

...

His purr starts. Low and deep, barely audible. A gentle rumble that rises from somewhere deep in his chest, from some mechanism that even veterinary science doesn't fully understand. Cats purr at a frequency between twenty-five and fifty hertz, which is the same frequency range used in vibration therapy to promote bone healing. But Monty doesn't know that. He just knows that when he lies down in his spot and the warmth comes up from below and the breathing surrounds him on both sides, his body starts to hum.

...

It's the softest sound in the world. Quieter than the clock downstairs. Quieter than the breathing. Quieter than the fridge or the tap or the settling of the embers. Just a faint vibration that you feel more than hear, transmitted through the mattress and the pillows and the duvet like a small, continuous, contented signal that everything is well.

...

...

It's the sound of a cat who has had his midnight feast. Who has eaten cold chicken by moonlight and washed his face with his paws and watched a fox cross the lawn and drunk clear water from his bowl and navigated fourteen stairs without making a sound.

...

Who has walked the quiet corridors of his sleeping house, checking on his kingdom, confirming that all is safe and warm and exactly as it should be.

...

And who has now returned to the warmest, safest, most beloved place he knows.

...

...

...

The purr slows. Softens. Fades to almost nothing. Just a whisper of vibration, barely there.

...

Monty's eyes close. First one, then the other. His breathing deepens. Matches the rhythm of the sleepers beside him.

...

In. And out. In. And out.

...

...

Three heartbeats in this bed now. Three bodies, warm and still and breathing together in the dark.

...

...

The cottage settles around them all. The old stones in the walls shift by fractions of a millimetre, the way they do every night, contracting in the cold, groaning so softly that only the house itself can hear.

...

The embers downstairs glow a little fainter. The last coal collapses silently into a bed of ash, and a final wisp of apple-wood smoke curls up the chimney and out into the night air, where it vanishes among the stars.

...

The clock ticks on, patient and eternal. It will still be ticking when the sun comes up, and when the kettle boils, and when someone opens the back door and lets the cold morning air rush in. But that's hours away. Hours and hours.

...

The moonlight inches slowly across the bedroom floor, tracking the silent movement of the earth through space. It reaches the edge of the rug, crosses it, and begins to climb the far wall, where it illuminates, for a moment, the small painting of a harbour that has hung there for as long as anyone can remember.

...

...

...

And outside, the world is frost and silence. Fields stretching away under the moon to the dark line of the hills. Hedgerows black against the sky. The barn owl, somewhere far off now, calling once, twice, then falling quiet.

...

Not a sound anywhere. Not a movement. Just the still, deep, beautiful quiet of the countryside at night.

...

...

...

Monty sleeps. Curled tight. Warm and full and perfectly happy.

...

And you sleep too. Right here. Right now. In this same warmth. This same peace. This same deep, unhurried quiet.

...

Somewhere, in some cottage, in some quiet corner of the countryside, a ginger cat is curled on a white duvet, purring so softly that only the pillows can hear. And somewhere, in a field beyond the garden, a fox is trotting through the frost, and an owl is gliding between the bare branches of an oak.

...

And the moon is watching all of it. Patient and silver and old. Pouring its light over everything. Over the cottage and the fields and the frozen garden and the sleeping cat and the sleeping people and the whole quiet, beautiful, sleeping world.

...

...

The midnight feast is over. The adventure is complete. The stairs have been climbed. The spot has been found.

...

And the only thing left to do is rest.

...

...

...

Let the quiet hold you. Let the warmth keep you. Let the purring in the dark carry you wherever you need to go.

...

...

Everything is still. Everything is safe. Everything is exactly where it should be.

...

...

...

...

Goodnight. Sweet dreams.

...

...
