Let your body find the bed tonight. Really find it. Sink into it.

...

Feel the mattress underneath you. Feel the pillow under your head. Feel the covers over you, warm and soft and exactly right.

...

...

Close your eyes. Let the world outside this room fade away.

...

There's a place I want to take you tonight. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere old. Somewhere that has been waiting for you.

...

...

...

Imagine a path. A narrow path of beaten earth, winding between the trunks of ancient trees.

...

You're standing at the edge of a wood. An old wood. The kind that has been here for hundreds of years, maybe longer. The kind of wood that was here before the roads and the towns and the fences.

...

...

The trees are enormous. Oaks, mostly, with thick, twisted trunks wrapped in ivy. Their branches spread wide overhead, interlocking with each other to form a living ceiling of leaves.

...

Here and there, a beech tree. Smooth silver bark, straight and tall, with leaves that catch what remains of the light and hold it like tiny green lanterns.

...

...

It's evening. Late evening. The sun set an hour ago, and the sky above the canopy is a deep, soft blue, fading to indigo at the edges.

...

But here, under the trees, the light is different. Filtered. Gentle. A dim, amber-green glow that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.

...

...

...

You step onto the path. The earth is soft under your feet. Centuries of fallen leaves have built up a layer of mulch that cushions every step.

...

You can feel it give slightly beneath you. Springy and quiet. Your footsteps make no sound at all.

...

...

The air is different in here. Cooler than outside, and rich with the scent of earth and bark and growing things. A green scent. A living scent.

...

Breathe it in. Let it fill your lungs. There's something about forest air that loosens things in you. Unnamed tensions. Small, hard knots of effort that have been sitting in your muscles all day.

...

...

The path curves gently to the left, following the contour of a low hill. You follow it. There's no need to hurry. The woods are patient. They've been patient for a very long time.

...

...

As you walk, the trees whisper.

...

That's the only word for it. A soft, continuous murmur that moves through the canopy above you. It's the breeze, of course. Just the evening breeze moving through thousands of leaves.

...

But it sounds like whispering. Like the trees are passing messages to each other, too quietly for you to hear the words. A conversation that's been going on for centuries.

...

...

...

The sound is extraordinary. It rises and falls like breathing. Sometimes louder, when the breeze strengthens. Sometimes barely there, just a rustle at the very edge of hearing.

...

It wraps around you as you walk. Surrounds you. Becomes the backdrop to everything.

...

...

The path takes you deeper. The trees grow closer together. The canopy thickens, and the light dims further, turning everything a soft shade of blue-grey.

...

...

You pass a fallen tree. A great oak that came down long ago, its trunk now covered in a thick coat of moss. Bright green moss, impossibly soft. The kind you want to reach out and touch.

...

...

So you do. You press your palm flat against it. It's like touching velvet. Cool and dense and alive. Tiny things are growing in it. Miniature ferns. Pinprick mushrooms. A whole landscape in miniature, living quietly on the side of a fallen giant.

...

...

...

You walk on. The path dips down into a shallow valley, and here the trees change. The oaks give way to birches. Slender and pale, their white bark peeling in papery strips.

...

They stand in groups, like friends gathered together, their thin branches trembling in the breeze.

...

...

Among the birches, the light is different again. More open. The canopy is thinner here, and patches of deep blue sky show through. A star appears in one of the gaps. Then another.

...

...

...

The whispering is softer here. The birch leaves make a lighter sound than the oaks. A shimmering, silvery sound, like distant water. Like a stream heard from far away.

...

...

And then you hear an actual stream.

...

A real one. Somewhere ahead, the quiet murmur of water running over stones. Gentle and continuous and deeply, deeply soothing.

...

...

The path leads you to it. A small stream, no wider than an arm's length, cutting a shallow channel through the forest floor. The water is clear and dark and moving slowly.

...

...

Flat stones break the surface here and there, and the water slides over them with a sound like someone saying shhh.

...

Over and over. Shhh. Shhh. Shhh.

...

...

...

You sit down on the bank. The ground is soft. Moss and leaf litter and the rich, dark earth of the forest floor.

...

...

...

...

The stream moves on. It doesn't need anything from you. It's been running through these woods since before anyone can remember, finding its way over stones and under roots, heading somewhere you don't need to know about.

...

...

Your breathing has slowed to match this place. Deep and easy and unhurried.

...

Your shoulders have dropped. Your hands rest loosely in your lap. Your whole body has understood, without being told, that this is a place of rest.

...

...

...

You stand, eventually, and follow the stream. The path runs alongside it now, and the sound of water accompanies every step.

...

...

The light is fading steadily. The blue-grey has deepened to something close to true darkness, but your eyes have adjusted. You can see the path clearly. You can see the pale trunks of the birches. You can see the occasional flash of the stream.

...

...

Small sounds reach you from the undergrowth. A rustle of dry leaves as something moves through them. A dormouse, perhaps. Or a hedgehog on its evening rounds.

...

Nothing that concerns you. Just the small, busy lives of the forest, carrying on as they always do.

...

...

...

The stream widens slightly and becomes shallower. The water spreads out over a bed of smooth pebbles, and the sound changes. Softer now. A gentle lapping, almost like tiny waves on a shore.

...

...

Ahead of you, the trees thin out. The path leads into a clearing.

...

You step out from under the canopy, and the sky opens up above you like a door swinging wide.

...

...

...

The clearing is small and perfectly round. Ringed by tall trees on every side, their branches reaching inward but not quite meeting. A circle of open sky directly above.

...

And that sky is filled with stars.

...

...

More stars than you've ever seen. The kind of sky you only get far from cities, far from lights, deep in the heart of the woods where the darkness is complete.

...

...

The Milky Way stretches across the opening like a river of light. Thousands upon thousands of tiny bright points, clustered and scattered, some steady, some flickering.

...

...

...

The clearing itself is carpeted with soft grass. Short and thick and silvered by starlight. It feels like stepping onto a cushion.

...

...

In the centre of the clearing, a large flat stone sits half-buried in the earth. Smooth and wide, like a table left here by the forest itself.

...

It's warm. Still holding the last of the day's heat, radiating it gently upward into the cooling air.

...

...

Lie down on the grass beside the stone. The earth supports you perfectly. The grass is soft against your back, your arms, the backs of your hands.

...

...

...

The trees stand around you like guardians. Tall and still and ancient. They've watched over this clearing for longer than you can imagine.

...

They're whispering still. That soft, continuous murmur. But from here, lying on your back, looking up at the stars, the sound is different.

...

It's gentler. More distant. Like a lullaby being sung from very far away.

...

...

...

...

...

The night has settled fully now. The last traces of blue have left the sky, and everything above you is black and silver and starlight.

...

...

The stream is still there, somewhere at the edge of the clearing. You can hear it. That quiet, continuous murmur. Water over stones. The oldest sound in the world.

...

...

The forest breathes around you. A slow, vast exhalation that moves through every branch and every leaf. The whole wood, breathing as one.

...

...

...

Your body is so heavy now. So perfectly, beautifully heavy.

...

The earth is holding you. The way it holds everything. Patiently. Completely. Without effort.

...

...

Your legs are warm and still. Your arms are loose. Your chest rises and falls so slowly now that each breath feels like a wave coming in and going out on some distant, quiet shore.

...

...

...

The whispering is fading. Not because it's stopped. Because you're sinking below it. Into a deeper quiet. Into the silence underneath the silence.

...

...

The stars turn slowly overhead. Ancient light, travelling for millions of years just to land here, in this clearing, on your closed eyelids.

...

...

...

Let them carry you now. The stars. The stream. The trees. The quiet, breathing forest.

...

They've been doing this for a very long time. They're good at it.

...

...

Let the whispering become your thoughts. Soft and formless and meaning nothing at all. Just sound. Just air. Just leaves.

...

...

...

And let the dark wrap around you like a blanket made of earth and sky and starlight.

...

...

There's nothing left to do. Nothing left to think. Nothing left to hold.

...

...

...

Just the woods. Just the night. Just the slow, sweet drift into sleep.

...

...

...

Everything is safe. Everything is still. The forest will be here all night, watching over you.

...

...

...

...

Goodnight. Sweet dreams.

...

...
