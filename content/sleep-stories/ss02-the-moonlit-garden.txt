Lie back tonight. Let the pillow take the weight of your head.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

Pull the covers close. Let your body settle.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

There's nowhere you need to be. Nothing you need to do. Just this. Just rest.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

Close your eyes when you're ready, and I'll take you somewhere beautiful.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

There's a garden. An old walled garden, hidden behind a stone house somewhere in the English countryside.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

You've been walking, gently, along a gravel path between tall hedges. The air is warm. It's a summer night, and the heat of the day is still held in the stone and the soil.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

You come to a gate. A wooden gate, painted blue once, long ago. The paint is peeling now, faded by years of sun and rain.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

You push it open. It swings on old iron hinges with a low, musical creak.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

And you step inside.

[SILENCE: 5 seconds]

The garden opens up before you, and it takes your breath away.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

It's bathed in moonlight. Full, silver moonlight that pours down from a cloudless sky and turns everything it touches into something from a dream.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

The garden is large. Larger than you expected. Surrounded on all sides by high stone walls covered in climbing roses and ivy and something with small white flowers that seem to glow in the dark.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

Jasmine. You can smell it already. That sweet, heavy, intoxicating scent that only comes alive at night.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

Let that scent settle over you. Breathe it in slowly, and let it ease something loose in your chest.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

There's a path. Pale gravel, almost white in the moonlight. It curves ahead of you through the garden, winding between flower beds and low hedges.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

You follow it. Slowly. There's no hurry here. There has never been any hurry in this garden.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

Your feet crunch softly on the gravel. It's the only sound. That, and the distant singing of a nightingale somewhere beyond the garden wall.

[SILENCE: 4 seconds]

The first flower bed you pass is lavender. Row upon row of it, planted in neat lines, every stem heavy with purple blooms.

[SILENCE: 1 seconds]

The scent rises as you brush past. Lavender and warm stone and summer earth. It's the smell of every peaceful evening you've ever known, distilled into one place.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

Your hand trails along the tops of the lavender stalks as you walk. The tiny flowers are dry and papery against your fingertips. They release more scent with every touch.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

Further along the path, the planting changes. Here are roses. Dozens of them. Old-fashioned roses with heavy heads that nod on their stems.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

In the moonlight, you can't tell their colours. They're all silver and shadow and dark velvet. But the scent tells you everything. Deep and sweet and layered with something almost like honey.

[SILENCE: 4 seconds]

You stop for a moment beside one bloom and lean in close.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

The petals are cool against your cheek. Impossibly soft. Each one curved and layered over the next like the pages of a very old, very precious book.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

You straighten up and walk on. The path curves to the right, around a low box hedge clipped into a gentle arc.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

And here, in the centre of the garden, you find the fountain.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

It's old. Carved from pale stone, weathered and softened by centuries. A simple basin, wide and shallow, with a single jet of water rising from the centre and falling back with a quiet, continuous sound.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

The water catches the moonlight as it falls. Each drop a tiny silver bead, arcing and tumbling. The surface of the basin ripples and shimmers.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

Sit down here for a moment. There's a stone bench beside the fountain. Wide and flat and smoothed by years. The stone is still warm from the day's sun.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

Let the sound of the water reach you. It's not loud. Just a gentle trickling, a soft and constant murmur. Like a voice too quiet to make out the words, saying something kind.

[SILENCE: 4 seconds]

The garden is alive around you, even in this stillness.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

Tiny things moving at the edges of your vision. A moth, pale and silent, circling the jasmine. A beetle crossing the path with small, determined steps.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

And fireflies. You notice them now. Small points of greenish light, drifting through the flower beds like sparks that have forgotten how to go out.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

They blink on and off. Here, then there. Never quite where you expect them. Each one a tiny, slow heartbeat of light in the warm dark air.

[SILENCE: 5 seconds]

When you're ready, you stand. Slowly. The bench releases you reluctantly, and the night air wraps around you like a warm shawl.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

The path continues beyond the fountain. It leads through an archway cut in a tall yew hedge, and you pass through it into a different part of the garden.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

This section is wilder. Less tended. The planting here is looser, softer. Grasses sway in a breeze so faint you can barely feel it on your skin.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

Tall foxgloves stand like sentries along the path, their bell-shaped flowers hanging heavy and still. In daylight they'd be purple and white. Now they're just pale shapes, ghostly and beautiful.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

The path becomes softer here. The gravel gives way to grass, thick and cool under your feet. You can feel the dew beginning to form, each blade of grass carrying a tiny bead of moisture.

[SILENCE: 4 seconds]

You walk through this meadow section of the garden slowly. The grasses brush your ankles. The scent here is different. Green and fresh. The smell of growing things.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

A stone wall runs along one side, and against it grows something you recognise. Honeysuckle. Tangled and sprawling, its trumpet-shaped flowers pale yellow in the moonlight.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

The scent is extraordinary. Sweet and wild and slightly green. It stops you in your tracks.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

You stand there, breathing it in. Each breath pulls the scent deeper, and with each breath, something in you relaxes a little more.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

Your shoulders drop. Your jaw softens. Your hands hang loose at your sides.

[SILENCE: 4 seconds]

The moon is high now. Directly overhead. Its light falls straight down into the garden, turning the dew on the grass into a carpet of tiny diamonds.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

The path curves again, and leads you under a wooden pergola draped with wisteria. The flowers are spent now, the purple clusters replaced by long, twisted seed pods. But the leaves form a canopy overhead, filtering the moonlight into a soft, dappled pattern on the ground.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

You walk through the pergola slowly. Your footsteps are silent on the grass. The wooden posts are rough and warm against your fingertips as you trail your hand along them.

[SILENCE: 4 seconds]

At the end of the pergola, the garden opens up one final time.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

Here is a small, private space. Sheltered on three sides by high hedges and on the fourth by the old stone wall of the house itself.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

And in the centre of this space, there's a daybed. A low, wide daybed with a thick linen mattress and a pile of soft cushions, all in shades of white and cream and faded blue.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

It was left here for you. As though someone knew you'd come walking through this garden tonight and would need, eventually, a place to rest.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

You lie down. The mattress gives softly beneath you. The cushions cradle your head. The linen is cool against your skin and smells of clean air and dried lavender.

[SILENCE: 4 seconds]

Above you, the sky is enormous. Endless. Filled with stars you can't see from the city. Thousands of them, scattered across the dark like sugar spilled on a black tablecloth.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

The jasmine scent drifts over from the wall. The fountain murmurs somewhere behind you, muffled by the hedges. The nightingale sings on.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

This is yours. This garden. This night. This perfect, private, moonlit corner of the world.

[SILENCE: 5 seconds]

The night deepens around you. The air cools, just slightly. Just enough to make the blanket of warmth from the daybed feel even more precious.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

The fireflies have followed you here. A few of them drift above the hedges, blinking their slow, patient light. On, then off. On, then off.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

Your body is heavy on the daybed. Heavy and warm and perfectly supported. Every muscle has found its resting position. Every joint has eased.

[SILENCE: 4 seconds]

The garden breathes around you. A slow, green, living breath. The plants drawing in the night air, releasing it, drawing it in again.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

You're part of that rhythm now. Your breathing has matched it without you trying. Slow and deep and effortless.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

The moonlight moves across the garden so slowly you can't see it happening. But the shadows have shifted, just slightly. The light on the stone wall has crept an inch to the left.

[SILENCE: 4 seconds]

The nightingale falls quiet. For a moment, the garden holds its breath.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

Then, from somewhere deep in the hedge, another bird answers. A softer call. Two notes, descending. Like a lullaby sung by something very small and very far away.

[SILENCE: 4 seconds]

Your thoughts have slowed to almost nothing. They drift past like the fireflies. Small, brief, unimportant. You don't need to follow any of them.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

The garden will be here all night. The fountain will keep trickling. The jasmine will keep breathing its scent into the warm air.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

And you can just lie here. On this daybed. In this garden. Under this moon. And let sleep come to you the way the dew comes to the grass.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

Slowly. Gently. Without effort. Without thought.

[SILENCE: 5 seconds]

The moonlight is your blanket. The garden is your room. The fountain is your lullaby.

[SILENCE: 5 seconds]

Let your eyes stay closed. Let your breathing slow. Let everything drift.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]

You're safe here. You're warm. You're held by the oldest, gentlest thing in the world.

[SILENCE: 2 seconds]

A garden. At night. Under the moon.

[SILENCE: 5 seconds]

And there's nothing left to do but sleep.

[SILENCE: 5 seconds]

Goodnight. Sweet dreams.

[SILENCE: 3 seconds]
