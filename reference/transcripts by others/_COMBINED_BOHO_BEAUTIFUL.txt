[Music]
Welcome to beautiful Costa Rica. Today,
our short yoga practice will be centered
on releasing tension and soothing any
soreness we may carry in our bodies.
Whether it's from long hours at a desk,
intense workouts, or the natural
stresses of life, we often find
ourselves holding on to tightness,
especially in our shoulders, hips, and
lower back. So today, through slow,
mindful movements, deep stretches, and
mindful breathing, you will gently ease
into each posture, allowing the body to
release and restore. So if you're ready
to get started, grab your mat and let's
begin.
We can stay the
same. Find a way
[Music]
through. Thank you friends so much for
joining me here today for this quick
yoga practice for your sore body. Let's
begin by finding a child's pose at the
very back of your mat. Bring the feet
together. Slightly open your knees to
give yourself
space. Interlace the fingers behind your
back. Extend through the elbows. Inhale.
Let's open the heart and the chest.
Maybe take a little rock side to
side. Then when you're ready, exhale.
Allow your forehead to come all the way
down as your knuckles point up to the
sky. Feeling a nice stretch in the
shoulders.
Inhale. Exhale. Slowly lift yourself
back up. Opening through the heart
center. And then releasing back down
with the forehead to the
mat.
Inhale. And exhale. Lift and
open. Keeping your fingers interlaced.
And then release. Arms. Reach back up to
the sky. And then from here, bending
your left elbow and grabbing that left
elbow with your right hand. Begin to
pull the elbow towards the center of
your body as you lengthen through the
spine. Feeling a nice stretch in your
tricep. Continuing to focus on that
elongation through the crown of your
head.
Inhale. Exhale.
Inhale. And then as you exhale, come on
up to your knees. Continue to hold that
same position with your arms. And then
step your right leg forward into a low
lunge. Feeling a nice stretch through
the left hip flexor. Continue to find
your balance. And pull that left elbow
towards the
midline. Staying focused on your breath.
Inhale. And as you exhale, allow your
hips to gently fall closer towards the
floor. Continuing to focus on that
release through the hip as well as your
tricep. Stay with your breath.
Inhale. And
exhale releasing the
hands. And then take your left arm
across your body. You can hold it with
the wrist of your right hand and pull it
across as you keep your shoulders
straight and square towards the front of
your
mat. Continuing to stay in your lunge
position. Really focusing on a different
sensation now through your arm and
shoulder.
Inhale and
exhale. and
release. From here, left arm reaches up,
right arm comes down, and then see if
you can take a little side body
stretch, lengthening through the left
hip flexor, left side body. Your right
hand can stay on your hip if you like.
And then both hands come down as you
extend into your halfslit. First, we're
just going to add some movement coming
forward into your lunge and then pushing
back into your halfslit.
Inhale forward into your
lunge. Exhale half
split. Inhale forward into your
lunge. Exhale half split. And now let's
hold. Again, really focusing on the
alignment of your body. So pull that
right hip back and slightly push the
left hip
forward. Lengthening through the leg.
Keeping your foot
flexed. If you like to add a little
stretch through the foot, take your
opposite hand. So, left hand grabs your
right foot and then slightly turn your
toes inward. You should notice a slight
different sensation through the actual
foot as
well. Feel free to play with it a little
bit and just see what feels nice.
[Music]
Inhale and
exhale.
Inhale and
exhale. Inhale. Come forward
again. Exhale. Step back with your leg
and sit back into child's pose. Let's
just take a moment. Connect to your
breath. Connect to your body. And when
you're ready, exhale. Come back to
seated. Reach your arms up. And now bend
your right elbow and grab your right
elbow with your left
hand. Seeing if you can touch the back
of your shoulder blades with your right
fingertips as you continue to pull that
elbow towards the midline of your body.
Lengthening through the spine.
Inhale.
[Music]
Exhale. Inhale
again. Exhale. Come on up to your knees.
And this time, left foot steps forward
into your low lunge. Continuing to
remain with that elbow pointed up to the
sky. Hold and breathe.
Noticing the different sensations in
your hip
flexor.
Inhale and
exhale. Awesome. From here, go ahead and
take that right arm now across the
body, holding and pulling it towards
your body with your left
wrist. Feel that nice stretch through
the shoulder as you continue to allow
your hips to drop down. Noticing a nice
beautiful stretch through the
leg through the
[Music]
soaz.
Inhale and exhale. Release. And then
take a little side stretch. Left arm
down, right arm up. And lengthen.
Lengthen through the body here.
Very
nice. Now let's
release and then push back into your
halfslit. Flexing your left foot. Adding
a little bit of movement first before we
find
stillness. Exhale. Push back. Flex your
foot. Inhale. Come
forward. Exhale. Push back.
Inhale, come
forward. And exhale, push back. And
let's find your stillness. Flex your
foot, square the hips out. So this time,
think of pulling your left hip back and
push the right hip
forward. Inhale and exhale as you let
go.
Now take your foot and then bring it
inward slightly. So you feel a different
sensation through the actual muscles in
your
foot. Breathe.
Inhale and
exhale. Return to
center. Shift your weight
forward and then step
back. Awesome. Tuck your toes. Deep
breath in. Exhale. Release into child's
pose once again. Just coming back to the
breath.
Inhale. Exhale. Now move your fingers to
the front of your mat. Bringing your
hips right on top of your knees and come
into puppy pose. Resting your forehead
on the floor. Or if you like to
intensify this release, bring your chin
to the
mat. Wherever you are, simply focus on
the inhale. And then the relaxation
through the
exhale.
Inhale and
exhale. Come back up to all fours. Take
your left arm, reach it up, and then
thread that arm all the way through into
our thread the needle. resting your
shoulder down and then extending the
other arm towards the front of your mat.
Once again, maintaining that hips over
knees position. And now noticing where
you feel that release through the
shoulders. One more
time.
Inhale. Close your eyes. And exhale.
Just let it go.
[Music]
Inhale and exhale.
[Music]
Very nice. Slowly from here, square the
shoulders out a little bit more and then
come back to
center. Releasing back in that puppy
pose just for a breath
in a breath out. See if you can go a
little
deeper. Really focusing on opening the
chest, opening those shoulders, your
upper back.
And then come back to center. Let's take
it to the other side. Right arm reaches
up. Thread that arm all the way through.
Drop your shoulder. And then your left
arm reaches to the front of your mat.
From this position, the more you can
bring that top left shoulder down, the
deeper you would feel the sensation
through that bottom
shoulder. So feel free to play with it a
little bit if you like.
Inhale and
[Music]
exhale.
Inhale and exhale.
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
All right. Now, slowly from here, let's
return back to
center. Dropping one last time into
puppy pose. And this time, see if you
can bend your elbows and place the hands
in anjeli mudra, your prayer
position. This arm variation allows you
to go a little bit deeper into the
triceps once
again, while still continuing to open up
through the shoulders and the upper
back.
Inhale and exhale.
Release the
hands and then slowly roll yourself up
to seated on top of your
heels. Finding a nice comfortable
position. Taking one last final deep
breath in, reaching your arms up. And
then exhale, bring your hands over to
your heart. Thank you so much for
joining me here today for this quick and
effective sore body yoga. I hope you
feel more open and released and ready to
continue onward with your day. From my
heart to yours, thank you.

============================================================

Welcome to beautiful Brazil. We are here
today in a special town called Trunkoso
with a morning yoga flow that will
energize and awaken your body from the
inside out. Through this practice today,
we will flow, breathe, open our hips,
and strengthen our body through a
perfect combination of focus, flow, and
stillness. So, if you're ready to get
started, grab your mat and let's begin.
[Applause]
[Music]
All right, friends. Let's get started
today. Seated along the center of your
mat with your feet crossed in front of
you. Taking a deep breath in here.
Coming into this present moment in your
body. And then reaching both of your
arms all the way up towards the sky when
you're
ready. Palms of your hands together. And
bring your hands down towards your
heart. Just taking this opportunity to
set an intention for your morning
practice today. To set an intention for
your day.
And then slowly whenever you're ready,
resting your hands on your knees, begin
to move your body in a circular motion,
diving the chest down and then all the
way back, making this movement as fluid
as you like. This is our very first
movement of the day. So go ahead and
just reverse the direction. We want to
make sure that we're doing what our body
is asking for
today. So move the body. Breathe.
Connect. Movement and breath. Last
inhale. Go ahead and just look
up. And then exhale. Bring your feet
together. Swing them over and around.
And let's come over to our all fours
position. This time go ahead and just
turn the hands so the fingertips are
pointed towards the knees. And this is
going to add a really nice stretch for
your forearms. We're going to start with
a cat cow. Keep your hands exactly in
that position. Inhale. Look up. Arch
your back. Exhale. Round the spine and
tuck the chin into the
chest. Inhale. Arch the
back. Exhale.
Round. Good. Keep it going. Really
feeling this lengthening sensation
through your forearms as you
[Music]
release.
Inhale. And exhale. Let it go.
Inhale. Now slowly walk so your
fingertips come back to that center and
then over towards the front of your mat.
Returning your spine to neutral. And go
ahead and extend your right leg behind
you. Pull the navl into the spine.
Engage your core. And then see if you
can reach your opposite arm forward into
your bird dog. Beginning this practice
here now by stabilizing the body and
waking up, engaging our
core, holding
still. And then rest your hand back over
to your mat. Go ahead and just take one
slow push up down. Keep your leg
extended. Bring it back up. And then
lower the chest all the way down.
Sliding your feet forward. And then
staying grounded with your hips as you
arch and lift the body. and release.
Lift the chest and the heart as you look
up. Exhale down for two. Beginning to
warm up the spine here. Inhale baby
cobra. Exhale
release. Inhale now. Lift up to your
knees and come back into child's pose.
Rounding out through the
spine. And then back over to all fours.
And let's go ahead and take it to the
other side. Left leg extends. Square the
hips. Pull the navl into the spine.
Right arm, opposite arm reaches
forward. The challenge of this posture
is to create stability and
stillness. So try not to move. Try to
keep that same height of the arm and the
leg. Right hand comes down. Go ahead,
come down to your push-up position.
Press up. Lower with the chest. Slide it
forward. And let's take our cobra lifts.
Lift it up. Exhale down. Inhale. Lift it
up. Exhale down. Feel free to make this
fluid. Follow with the head. Now lift
up. Lift the thighs off the floor into a
full upward-facing dog. Press into the
hands. Exhale. Push back. Downwardfacing
dog. Beautiful. Let's go ahead and give
our body a moment to just release any
tension in this posture. So add gentle
movement. Maybe sway your hips side to
side. Move your feet. Move your chest,
your shoulders. And then reach your
right leg up to the sky into your
three-legged dog. Bending that top knee.
Let's circle the hip by bringing the
knee down and around for one. Circle it
around for
two. Three. And one more.
And now let's go a little deeper into
the hip. What you're going to do is
place your right ankle top of your left
knee. Lift your left heel and drop down
towards your left knee. And then begin
to sit back into this pigeon
variation. So what we're doing here is
going really deep into the right glute
muscle, stretching the back left toes
and releasing the body
forward. Breathing deeply here. And with
your exhalation, allow yourself to relax
into this
posture. Feeling that release in the
glute.
[Music]
Inhale.
Exhale.
Hold.
Breathe.
Enjoy.
Let's take one more deep breath
in. On your exhalation, go ahead and
look forward. Bring yourself back up.
Downward-facing dog, but that right knee
stays bent. And then just release the
right ball of your foot towards the left
side of your left
foot. And then right knee to chest. Step
your right foot between your two hands.
and reach both arms up to the sky into
your crescent
lunge. Hold for a breath and then
release your hands down. Step back into
plank,
chaturanga, upwardfacing dog as you
inhale all that air into your body and
exhale downward-facing dog as you let it
go. Let's take it to the other side.
Left leg reaches up. Bend your left
knee. Open the hips into three-legged
dog. And then begin to circle that left
knee in and around for
one and
two and
three and four. Beautiful. Left ankle
comes over to the top of your right
knee. Drop down to your right knee and
then sit back with your hips going
really deep into the left glute muscle.
Now your right toes are staying tucked
under. So, you're feeling that stretch
in the right foot while you begin to
surrender and release deeper into this
posture, feeling that release through
the left side of your glute of your
hip. Stay with your breath.
Inhale and exhale. Let it go.
Taking this moment to notice if you feel
any sensations appearing in your
body restrictions, tensions, just note.
And then begin to move through it coming
over to your hands and then back into
that downward-facing dog with your left
foot crossed in front of your
right. Great job. From here, left knee
to your chest. Step your left foot top
of the mat. Arms reach up into your
crescent
lunge. Left knee on top of your ankle.
Slowly release your body all the way to
the mat. Step back into plank position.
And then take your
chaturanga, upward-facing
dog. Exhale, push into the hands, lift
the hips, and release into your
downward-facing dog.
Beautiful. Inhale deeply.
Exhale
softly. Go ahead and begin to walk now.
Your feet towards the front of your mat.
Come on over to your standing forward
fold. Resting your head all the way.
Relax. Allow your neck to feel super
heavy. Maybe add a little bit of
movement into the neck by looking side
to
side, bending your knees, and then
rolling yourself up to standing. Take
your time here.
Once you're up, go ahead and find that
center as you reach both arms up to the
sky. Look up. Exhale, dive it down into
your forward fold. Inhale halfway.
Exhale, step all the way back to plank.
Chaturanga, upward-facing
dog. And exhale, downwardfacing
dog. Inhale deeply. Exhale, step your
right foot top of the mat. Ground your
left heel. Arms reach up into your
warrior 1. From warrior 1, we're going
to take our eagle arms. Left elbow
underneath your right elbow. Intertwine
your wrist. Palms together. Let's add
movement by diving down with the elbows
and then up. Lower the chest and up for
two.
Inhale. And
three.
Inhale. And four. Good. Hold it here.
Now open up those arms and then take
your extended side angle, right elbow to
your right
knee, feeling this lengthening sensation
through your side
body. And then go ahead and take it all
the way back into your peaceful
warrior, reaching that right arm all the
way towards the back of the mat.
[Music]
Back over to extended side angle, but
this time your right fingertips are
reaching all the way to the
floor. See if you can extend this pose
even longer. If this is too deep for
you, then go ahead and come back to that
first variation where the elbow is on
top of the knee.
Let's come back into a warrior 2
now. Bringing your hands back into that
eagle arm position, pivoting the hips
and stepping forward to the top of the
mat. And then the left knee comes over
top of your right knee into a full eagle
pose. Go ahead and come down as low as
you can here.
Focus.
Inhale. Exhale. Go ahead and release the
foot. Then release your hands back over
towards your heart center. Continuing
with our movement. Inhale. Reach up.
Look
up. Exhale. Dive it down towards the
mat. Inhale
halfway. Exhale. Step back into plank.
And then take your
chaturanga upward-facing
dog. And exhale. push it back and
release into your downward-facing
dog. Let's go ahead and take it to the
other side. Left foot steps forward.
Right heel grounds as you reach up into
your warrior one. Taking your eagle
arms. This time, right elbow underneath
the
left. Good. From here, adding movement
with the body by dipping down and
looking up. Elbows down towards that
front knee. Exhale. Look up. Lower the
body. Bring the body back
up. Lower the
body. Bring it all the way up. Great.
From here, open up your body even more.
Release the arms. Warrior 2. And then
extended side angle with your elbow to
the knee as your top back arm reaches
towards the front of your
mat. Awesome. And then come back over
into that peaceful warrior to the other
side.
[Music]
And then back into that extended side
angle, but this time taking it one step
further by reaching the hand all the way
towards the
[Music]
ground. Good. Close your eyes if that
feels good. Try to look up towards the
ceiling.
[Music]
And then slowly release back into
warrior 2. Eagle arms. Pivoting the
body, deepening into that warrior one.
And then transitioning over to the front
of your mat. Lift the right knee up.
Bend it over your left knee and come
into your eagle pose.
trying to keep your elbows and your
knees aligned in one

bringing your hands over towards your
heart. Good. Just find that center, that
presence. And then inhale, reach both
arms up as you look up. Exhale, dive it
down into your forward fold. Inhale
halfway. Exhale, step back into your
high plank. Chaturanga dandasana all the
way
down. Inhale upward-facing
dog. And exhale, push back, release into
your downward-facing
dog. And then once you're ready, go
ahead and lift your
heels, bend your knees, and then I want
you to hop to the front of your mat.
Inhale halfway, and then exhale slowly.
From here, see if you can reach for the
back of your elbows. So, going into a

fold and then
release and come on over to your seated
position along your mat.
extending your legs in front of you.
Flex your feet. Reach both arms
up. And then as you exhale, folding from
your hips, coming into your seated head
to toe forward fold, releasing your body
all the way over top of your legs if you
can. Close your
eyes and take this opportunity to go
inward, checking in with your body,
checking in with how you're feeling in
this moment.
With each
exhalation, giving yourself permission
to go deeper and deeper into this deep
releasing
aa.
Inhale. Exhale. Release your hands. Come
on up to your seated position. Hands
behind your back. Point your toes. And
then lift up into a reversed plank.
Squeeze your glutes. Throw your head
back if that feels good. And then scoot
forward towards the front of your mat.
Bend your knees and roll yourself all
the way down with control. And then once
your back is flat on the mat, hug your
knees into the chest, giving yourself a
little gentle rock, a little massage of
the spinal cord. And then let's come
into our happy baby. Extend your legs,
grab the outsides of your feet, bend
your knees, and pull those knees down
towards the mat. Continuing to stay with
your eyes closed, keep your internal
awareness and simply notice any
sensations that may be happening in your
hips. If you're feeling stiff this
morning, a little bit more tense, just
breathe into it. With each exhalation,
allow yourself to melt deeper and deeper
into this
posture. Maybe adding some movement,
maybe staying in stillness.
Wherever you are is perfect. Just
breathe.
Inhale and exhale. Enjoying this deep
hip opening
posture. Inhale once
again. Exhale. Let it
go.
Slowly extending your
legs. Release the feet. Arms down. And
slowly lower the legs for five. Use your
core. Four 3
2 one and release. Awesome. Bend your
knees into the body now. And then plant
your feet onto the mat. Opening the
knees out to the side with the soles of
your feet together in
sabbarakanasana. One hand on the belly,
one hand on your heart. Go ahead and
close your eyes. And let's complete this
practice together today with a quick
practice of a three-part
breath. Inhaling into the belly, ribs,
and
chest. Exhaling out of the chest, the
ribs, and then the belly.
Following this simple movement of the
breath as you inhale, belly, ribs,
chest. Exhale, chest,
ribs,
belly. Good. With each
exhalation, allow yourself to relax
deeper and deeper.
This is a moment in your day right now
where you can truly find
stillness. Connect to your
breath. Connect to your own internal
energy that is vibrating within
you. And remind yourself that you hold
the power to create a beautiful day for
yourself today.
You are in control of how you react to
every situation and
circumstance that life may bring your
way
[Music]
today. That
you always have a
choice to choose to react through love,
compassion, and
kindness. Continuing with your
three-part
breath as you allow
yourself to find that
stillness, that inner
peace, that blissful state of present
awareness.
[Music]
Let's take one more deep breath
in. And then slowly bring your knees
together, right arm over, roll to one
side, and come on up to your seated
position on your
mat. Crossing your feet in front of you
just as we began. Close your eyes and
return back to that center.

position. And take this opportunity
right now to bow down towards your own

============================================================

Welcome to beautiful Costa Rica.
Today is going to be a yin yoga practice
where we will focus on gentle movement
and stillness to release tension in both
the body and the mind. Each yin posture
will be held for 2 minutes today,
allowing you to soften into each moment
to stay connected to your breath,
letting it guide you into a place of
stillness.
Today, I welcome you to let go of the
outside world and bring your focus
inward. With every breath, release the
tension in your hips and clear the
clutter from your mind. Take this time
for you. Let the stillness and gentle
movement bring balance and ease into
your body and mind. Let's begin.
[Music]
Thank you friends for joining me here
today.
Let's begin by finding a comfortable
seated position anywhere along your mat
with your feet crossed in front of you.
Dropping your shoulders down away from
the ears.
Close your eyes and just take this
opportunity to bring all of your
awareness internally.
Perhaps placing your hands upon your
heart and slowly taking this moment to
listen to your own heart beating in your
chest,
reminding you of this beautiful pronic
life force that exists within you.
Reminding you of this present moment,
of your breath,
of your being.
Inhale.
And as you exhale, just gently let go of
your arms. And let's go ahead come over
to your child's pose. So, walk all the
way to the back of your mat, sitting
onto your heels, taking a deep breath in
and reaching both of your arms up to the
sky. Then exhale, throwing your head
back. And just bring your heart to
center as you connect. Again, big breath
in, reach your arms up.
Exhale, bend your elbows, and bring your
hands to heart.
One more time. Inhale, reach the arms
up.
And then exhale, bring them all the way
down as you release.
Reaching your arms down to the front of
your mat. And coming into our child's
pose, resting your forehead down. Taking
this as our first yin posture today.
Easy child's pose.
Closing your eyes and taking again an
opportunity to bring your internal
awareness forward.
Noticing everything from your breath
to the way your heart beats in your
chest to the expansion of your rib cage
as you breathe in and out.
Inhale
and exhale.
Simply allowing yourself to stay with
your breath.
noticing to the sensations
inside your body. As you inhale
and then as you exhale,
inhale
and exhale.
Let's take one more inhale
and then on your next gentle and slow
exhalation,
take all of your fingers and make a tent
pressing the fingertips onto the floor
of the mat. Lift your elbows. And then
press into those fingertips as you
extend through the arms. Look up to the
sky. And then exhale. Bring your knees
together and walk over into all fours
position. Let's add a little bit of
gentle movement now into the spine
before we go into our next still
posture. Starting to just circle your
head and your chest.
Making this movement as large or small
as you like, involving some movement of
your hips.
and then increasing the movement to
involve your knees a little bit and your
shoulders.
And then just reverse the direction
continuing to move in the same manner.
Making this feel good inside your own
body. Doesn't matter what it looks like.
All that matters is how it feels.
So allow this movement to guide you
deeper and deeper into this connection.
Beautiful. And then from here, go ahead
and bring both of your hands closer to
the front of your mat. Remaining your
hips on top of your knees. Come down
into our next yin posture, which is your
puppy pose.
If you like to go a little deeper into
the triceps, you're more than welcome to
connect the palms of your hands together
and bend your elbows. So coming into a
prayer anjeli mudra
the choice is yours but wherever you are
just stay and once again close your eyes
and allow your exhalation to guide you
deeper into this relaxed state
inhaling
and exhaling.
Inhale
and exhale.
[Music]
[Music]
Very nice, my friends. Just stay with
your breath. We're almost done. Go ahead
and welcome another deep breath in
through both nostrils. Really feel that
oxygen entering your body.
And then exhale, release.
Look up.
And then gently walk your way back into
all fours position.
Take your time. And once you're ready,
go ahead and tuck your toes behind you.
And then shift your weight to your
heels. And then come back to center.
Let's just do this three times. moving
your hips back and forward, feeling a
nice stretch through your feet and your
toes. And then the final time, go ahead
and lift, extend through the knees,
extend into your downward-f facing dog.
Adding as much movement here as you
like.
Feel free to feel that nice stretch
through the back of your legs. Hold and
breathe. Inhale
and exhale.
Inhale
and exhale.
[Music]
Finding that stillness,
finding your breath. One more inhale.
And then on your exhale, walk your feet
towards your hands. We're going to come
into a forward fold here. Slight bend in
the knees. Relax your head and your
neck. And just begin to gently rock side
to side.
Good. And then once you're ready, come
on over to your mat. Once again, we're
going to come into a butterfly. So bring
the soles of your feet together. Allow
your knees to open nice and wide. We're
going to get into the hips here. Hold on
to your ankles first. I'd like you to
inhale and really think of elongating
through the spine. And then exhale
rounding forward. So three times we're
just going to add this gentle movement.
Inhale.
Exhale, release. Forehead towards the
toes. Inhale again.
Exhale, bend your elbows and release.
Inhale, extend.
And exhale. Very nice. Go ahead and
hold.
Hold it here. Allow that forehead to
drop to your toes.
Knees are open. You're breathing into
the hips.
With each exhalation, just really focus
on that relaxation,
allowing the knees to feel heavier and
heavier
as your chest gently drops closer and
closer towards the feet, towards the
earth, towards the mat.
Inhale
and exhale.
[Music]
[Music]
Great. Go ahead and take another deep
breath in.
And then exhale out. Go ahead and lift
up.
From here, we're going to extend both of
your legs.
Coming into our next asa, our dragonfly.
A little bit more intense on the hips.
So, just choose the version that fits
best. Opening the knees as you're
comfortable. Flexing your feet. Inhale.
Let's just reach. Lengthen the spine
first. Exhale. Bring your hands to your
heart.
connecting to that breath again. Inhale,
reach up.
Exhale, let all that air out as your
arms and hands come to your heart.
One more time. Inhale, reach up.
And exhale, bring it down. This time, go
ahead and walk your hands forward.
Making sure that your feet stay flexed
with the toes pointed up towards the sky
and your knees pointed up as well.
So really up to you. You can come down
to your elbows. You can come all the way
down with your heart and chest onto the
floor. Or just stay with your hands on
the mat. Wherever you are, allow
yourself the opportunity to close your
eyes. And again, just take away all that
external disturbance,
external distractions, and simply go
inward.
Focusing on the inhale.
and the exhale.
Inhale
and exhale.
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Wonderful. My friends,
let's slowly begin to come out of this
posture now. Taking one more deep breath
in
and then exhale slowly make your way up
to your hands once again.
Finding that inhale. Exhale releasing
the legs and bring both of your feet now
to the front of your mat.
Scoot over so you have the entire mat
here to use. Planting your hands onto
the floor. Go ahead and lift your hips
into reversed high plank.
And then you're going to slowly drop
your hips back down. Flex your feet.
Inhale. Arms reach back up. Exhale. Take
a forward fold.
We're going to do this two more times
just to get your body a little bit more
open. Inhale. Lift the hips. Throw the
head back.
Exhale. Drop it down. Flex your feet.
Reach the arms up. and come on down.
Forward fold.
Inhale. Point your toes.
Lift your hips up to the sky. Throw your
head back.
Exhale. Flex your feet. Reach the arms
up. Inhale.
Exhale. Come on down. Now, you can open
up your feet a little wider if that's
more comfortable. You can also hold the
back of your knees. Wherever you are, go
ahead and relax forward.
Just allow your body to let go.
Focusing on the inhale and the exhale.
Inhale
and exhale.
Go inward.
Try to listen to all that comes through.
Exhaling all that no longer serves you.
Surrendering all the heaviness
into the earth
as you allow your breath to make you
feel lighter, more open to love and the
universe.
So breathe. Inhale
and exhale.
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Very nice. One more inhale.
[Music]
Exhale. Come on up.
Release the hands to your heart. Point
your toes. And then scoot forward just
slightly just to make sure you have the
entire mat to use as you slowly come
down vertebrae by vertebra.
Good. Come all the way down. Bring your
knees into the chest.
Take a gentle rock side to side just to
massage your spine.
Then from here for our final posture you
have the choice to either extend your
legs into a shabasana and just let go or
take a reclined butterfly pose by
placing the soles of your feet together
and allowing the knees to open. This
will be a slightly more advanced hip
opening and the closure to our practice.
So your choice wherever you are go ahead
and close your eyes
and once again just begin to let go
with each exhalation allowing your body
to feel heavier
surrendered into the earth
allowing yourself to be held
to be comforted
by the earth underneath you.
So with this simply
give yourself the permission to let go.
Inhale
and exhale.
[Music]
Let
go.
[Music]
Now, when you're ready to bring movement
back into your body, you may simply
Start to wiggle your fingers, your toes.
Bring your knees together.
Roll over to one side.
Then come on up to a seated position on
your mat.
Find your seat. Find your breath.
Find your grounding, your stillness.
Welcoming that breath one more time
and letting it go as you bring the hands
together in front of your heart and
bowing down to your own heart in
gratitude. Gratitude for your practice,
for your dedication, for your health,
your well-being, and for the time that
you found in your busy schedule to
dedicate to your health and self-care.
From my heart to yours, thank you so
much. Sending you love and light.
Namaste.

[Music]
Welcome to today's powerful yoga flow
created to help you burn through
stagnant energy and reclaim your inner
strength. Throughout life, we often
absorb energy from the world around us,
tension from conversations, stress from
environment, heaviness from people or
situations that don't align with our
truth. This class today is your space to
shake that off, to move it out, and to
let it go. With each breath, we will
detox the body, clear the mind, and
reconnect to the steady current of power
that's always been within you. We're not
just building strength, we're
transmuting energy, releasing the weight
of what's not yours, and calling in
vitality, clarity, and grounded
confidence.
This is your time to move, breathe, and
rise. So with that, once you have
everything you need, let's begin.
[Music]
Welcome my dear friends. Thank you so
much for joining me here for this
practice. Let's begin by coming to the
very front of our mat. We're going to
start standing. Taking an opportunity to
ground all your ten toes in the mat.
Grounded through the feet. Roll your
shoulders down away from the ears and
simply plant the palms of your hands
together at your heart. Take a deep
breath
in. When you're ready, exhale. Simply
release your arms at your side. On your
next breath, go ahead and let's reach
both arms up. Look all the way up. And
then exhale, bend your elbows and begin
to fall forward towards the front of
your mat, allowing your head to relax
here for a moment.
Inhaling, looking up, bending your
knees, and exhale, rolling yourself up
to standing, following the movement of
your breath as you inhale, and exhale,
let it
go. Inhale halfway, look up. Exhale,

Slight little spinal twist. Starting to

spine, letting go of anything that might
have felt heavy today. Just come into
the body. Next breath in, let's reach
the arms back up to the
sky. Exhale, forward fold all the
way. Inhale, halfway lengthen. And then

your right knee. Right elbow points up
to the sky. And feel free to look up to
the sky or just straight ahead or to the
mat. And then from here, go ahead and
step the other foot all the way back
into a high lunge. If you like to drop
the knee down to the floor, that's fine.
You can take that modification.
Otherwise, keep it lifted and hold and
find your balance for a moment. Find
your inhale. Exhale. Untwist your body.
And reach your arms up into high
lunge. Inhale.
As you exhale, let's begin to release
all of our weight all the way to the
front of your mat. Coming into warrior

of your mat as you inhale.
Exhale. Come down into utkatasana

twist to the other side. Right elbow to

go of any energy you feel in your body
at this time in your heart. Any heavy
energy, let it go.
Exhale. And now opening, coming into
your warrior 2. Let's continue with that
energetic release by flexing your wrist
and pointing the palms of your hands.
And then from here, you're going to push
that energy forward to the front of your
mat and then back. Push, push, push.
With your exhale, like you're pushing
that negativity, that frustration, that
anger, whatever you feel inside of you,
I want you to push it
away. And then make that clean energy
slate in front of your heart. Open it
out. Open the palms of your hands.
Inhale. And now, as we've cleared that
energy a little bit from here, we
exhale. We let ourselves create that
space in the heart, that space in the
chest, in your body, in your energetic
body. Placing one hand behind you.
Exhale, extend your arms. Your knees are
straight. And release into your triangle
pose.
Once again, breathing deeply into the
intercostal muscles, the muscles in
between your rib cage, creating that
space for more air to come in for a
deeper inhale, for more energy of love
and positivity to enter your body.

that front arm to the back. Possibly

breath. Maybe even making an audible
exhale as you
release. Find that power. Find that
energy. Let go of all that no longer
serves
you. You hold the power to find your
peace. Open into warrior 2.

away from your body. And now I want you
to push that energy from the back to the

experience you might have went through,

just like we started our class today.
Hands at your heart center. Close your
eyes. Perhaps place your hands onto your
heart. Listening to your own heartbeat.
Connect with that
energy. Whatever might have taken your
energy today, know that you have the
power to bring it all back.
You deserve to be at peace and you
deserve to be surrounded by love, joy,
and happiness in every
way. So connect to that
energy. Reclaim your own
power and let go of
all that no longer serves you or your
well-being.
Find your
breath and through your exhale, ground
into this beautiful positive
energy. Ground into your
body. Ground into your heart.
When you're ready, you may simply place
the palms of your hands together one
more time as a gesture of gratitude at

Heat. Heat.
Welcome to beautiful Iceland. We are
here today in front of this powerful and
magical waterfall with a peaceful and
heart connective yoga flow. The
intention of this incredible space and
water is here to remind you of the power
that resides within your own heart.
I encourage you to let the sound of the
water today become your guide. Washing
away all that no longer serves you, all
that blocks the natural radiance of your
being.
As you move through this yoga practice,
feel the energy of the earth beneath you
and the vastness of the cosmos above
you. Let them meet within your heart and
allow this short practice today be your
gift to yourself. A moment to return to
love, to open,
to forgive,
and to embrace yourself fully and
completely.
Welcome to your practice.
Welcome my friends. Thank you so much
for joining me here today for this
practice. We're going to get started by
finding a comfortable seated position
along the back of your mat. Bring your
feet and your knees together. Placing
one hand on your belly, the other on
your heart center. Let's welcome a
three-part breath, pranayyama.
Allowing yourself to come into this
present awareness.
Inhaling into the belly, the ribs, and
the heart. And then exhaling out of the
heart, the ribs, and the belly. Inhaling
belly, ribs, chest.
Exhaling chest, ribs, and belly.
When you're done three rounds, go ahead
and take a big breath in and reach both
of your arms up to the sky. And then
exhale. Bend your elbows and bring your
hands over towards your third eye with
your eyes closed. Taking this
opportunity to set an intention for your
practice, allowing yourself to open your
heart and your mind as you reach your
arms back up to the sky. bring them
around and then reach them to the front
of your mat as you release into your
child's pose. With your eyes closed,
just stay connected to that breath.
Noticing how your body is feeling in
this very moment.
Slowly coming back to center and then
dropping over to your belly and hips.
Pressing the hands into the mat. Just
take gentle lifts of the chest and heart
off the mat. and then release back down.
Working with the breath. Inhale, open
up. Feel free to keep your eyes closed,
though. Exhale, forehead down. Press
into the mat. Inhale, look up.
Exhale, release. One more time.
Press into the hands.
And then slowly come back over to your
hands and knees. Cat cow. Exhale as you
round. Inhale as you arch.
Exhale.
Inhale.
Nice gentle movement into the spine.
Connecting movement and breath as one.
Wonderful. And then slowly from here,
keep your hips above your knees. Reach
your hands forward and allow your heart
to come all the way down to the earth.
Bending at your elbows, place the hands
in anali mudra.
Taking your puppy pose while at the same
time feeling a beautiful release through
the triceps.
Keeping your hands in prayer position
again as a gesture of gratitude, of
connection, allowing yourself to stay
rooted in the breath as you give your
body the permission to let go of any
tension,
constriction,
or resistance.
Beautiful. Let go. Drop it back down to
your belly and hips. Inhale back into
baby cobra. Holding here for two deep
breaths. Very intentional movement. And
then exhale. Bring the hands down and
see if you can lift up a little higher.
Coming up into upward-facing dog at this
time. Going a little deeper through this
back bend. And then tuck your toes under
and press yourself up into our first
downward-facing dog.
Let's add a little bit of movement here.
bending one knee at a time, walking it
out on one spot,
and then walking as much as you need to
to feel that release in the calf
muscles. And once you're ready, you can
just find a little bit of stillness,
connect to the breath,
noticing every sensation
internally and externally.
Good. Bending your knees. And at this
time, go ahead and walk your feet to the
very front of your mat. Bringing the
fingertips onto the ground, maybe
slightly opening your feet, taking the
opposite elbows, and just taking a
gentle ragd doll. Moving your body left
and right. Making sure you're bending
from the hips. So, bending the knees
slightly to allow that to happen.
And then slowly rolling yourself up to
standing. Continuing to hold on to those
elbows. Open up through the chest. Open
up through the heart. Bend those elbows
now into cactus arms.
Release the fingers. Inhale.
Exhale. Go all the way back. Push the
hips forward. See if you can go a little
bit deeper.
Inhale. Center. Exhale. Allow your body
to fall towards the right. You can
interlace your fingers except the index
fingers here. Feeling that nice opening
sensation through the left side of your
body. Looking up towards the sky or look
towards the front. Inhale.
Exhale. Center. And take it to the other
side. Same thing. Make sure the hips and
shoulders are facing towards the same
way.
Breathing into the opposite side now.
Feeling the restriction. And then
breathing a little bit more oxygen into
that area of your body. Beautiful. Come
to center. Inhale. Open up one more
time. Release the hands. Bend your
elbows. Place the hands at your third
eye. Once again, bowing to that
connection of your mind and body as you
release yourself all the way down into
forward fold.
Inhale. Come up to the fingertips.
Exhale. I'd like you to step your right
leg all the way back coming into your
low lunge. And then same thing, feel
free to interlace your fingers except
the index fingers pointed up towards the
sky. Feel that extension and release of
the soaz muscle. Inhale. Good. Knee
above your ankle. Exhale. See if you can
lift your back knee now off the mat.
Hold and find that balance. Find that
grace and stability. Connecting to your
breath, to your intention and your focus
as you root through that foot. Drop the
back knee back down.
Release the fingers and the hands. Bring
the hands back to your heart. And then
take a gentle twist. Right elbow towards
the outside of your left knee. Left
elbow should be pointed up towards the
sky. You can keep your gaze down or up.
Just noticing this gentle constriction
of your digestive organs.
Welcoming fresh blood flow into that
area of your body. Breathing deeply and
consciously into it.
Inhale
and exhale.
Untwist the body.
On your next breath, simply release the
hands. Place them onto the mat. And then
push back as you flex the front foot
into your halfslit.
Inhale, come forward.
Exhale, push back. Arahanasana.
Inhale, come forward.
And exhale, push back, finding
stillness.
And release. As you welcome that breath
as you hold this posture, the more you
can flex the front foot, the deeper
you're going to feel the sensation
through your calf muscle. So breathe
deeply into it.
Exhale it all out.
Inhale.
Exhale. Slowly release.
Just start to roll that front ankle.
Taking circular motions to one side and
then the other direction. Bringing a
little bit of love into the ankle
joints.
And then from here, just simply come
back over
low lunge. Lift the back knee off the
mat. Step back into a high plank. Deep
breath in.
Drop down to your knees. Chest and chin.
Slide your body forward and open into
upward-facing dog.
Pressing into the hands. Exhale. Push
back and release. Downward-facing dog.
Breathe it out. Connect to the breath.
Connect to the ASA. Connect to your
intention,
the reason of what brought you here
today.
Connecting to that energy within you.
Lift the heels and start to walk your
feet towards the front of your mat. Once
again, coming into your forward fold.
Deep breath in. Bend your knees and
slowly start to roll up to standing.
Reaching both arms up to the sky.
Exhale. Bring your hands back over to
your third eye. Closing your eyes. Just
connecting to that energy.
Connecting to your own heart. The
frequency that it radiates.
Connecting to your body.
Connecting to your soul, your true
essence.
welcoming a breath of forgiveness,
a cleansing breath of gratitude for all
that you have in this world. Inhale, go
ahead and extend your arms up once again
as you open that heart back up to the
universe, holding this gentle back bend.
Exhale, bend both knees. This time, take
your left foot and just bring it behind
you and take your side reach one more
time.
bending to the side, but this time a
slight different variation of the feet.
Noticing how that plays into the
sensations within your body, welcoming
as much oxygen as you can as you go
deeper and deeper.
Come back to center. Inhale, reach up to
the sky. And then exhale. Same thing.
Take your right foot. Now you can
slightly bend a supported knee to make
sure you're holding your balance. And
then reach towards the left side of your
body. Reach as far as you can. Breathe
deeply.
Slowly back to center. Arms reach back
up.
Exhale. Bring your hands back up to your
third eye.
Slowly bowing down gently coming about
halfway. Hands to your heart now. And
then release the hands back to the
earth.
Inhale. Come up to halfway. Bend your
knees and this time step your left leg
back. Drop your left knee and open your
arms into your low lunge. Interlacing
all fingers except the index.
Hold it here. Breathing deeply. Noticing
the sensation on the other side, your
left side,
the feminine side, the lunar side of
your body. See if you can lift that back
knee for a little bit more challenge if
that feels right. Just staying aware how
this side compares to the one before.
Noticing if it's tighter, if it's
lighter, there's more resistance in the
mind to it. Bring the knee back down.
Bring the hands to your heart. And then
take a gentle twist with your left elbow
towards that right knee. Right elbow
points up to the sky. Hold it here. Take
a deep breath.
If you like to advance this ASA, you can
always lift the back knee off the mat if
you like or keep it grounded for a
little extra support.
Inhale
and exhale. Beautiful.
Awesome. Now untwist the body. Reach
both arms back up. Release the hands.
And then push back. Flex your foot and
allow yourself to release forward. Come
back into low lunge. Inhale. Exhale.
Push back. Flex your foot and release.
Forehead to knee. Inhale forward
and exhale. Push back into your
arahanasana.
Feeling the release of your hamstring
here with your front foot flexed. Take a
deep breath in
and exhale out.
Wonderful. Another deep breath
and exhale.
Wonderful. Now slowly come up slightly
with your body. Let's just add those
nice circles of the ankle. Rotating the
front foot one way
and then reverse in the direction the
opposite way. Just noticing again where
the constriction or resistance may lie
within the small ligaments and muscles
within your foot.
And then from here, bend your knee, tuck
your back toes, lift the back knee off
the mat. Inhale. Exhale, come into high
plank position. Inhale, hold.
Exhale, chaturanga dandasana or modify
by coming down to your knees. Inhale,
hold.
And exhale, tuck your toes, and push
back into downward-facing dog. Once
again, coming into that stillness, that
connection. One more time, spread those
fingers wide. Feel the palms of your
hands on the earth. And then when you're
ready, bend your knees. I'd like you to
jump and just land in a cross-legged
position.
Coming over to butterfly pose, bringing
the soles of your feet together,
allowing the knees to open. Grab onto
those toes. Inhale, like you to open the
chest. And then exhale, bend your
elbows, and come down with your forehead
to the mat.
Inhale, extend your elbows, look up.
Exhale, release. And again, inhale, look
up.
Exhale, release. Let's hold it here now.
Allowing the knees to softly open.
Again, noticing where the resistance
appears within the hips. With each
exhalation, allowing your body to go
gently lower, lower, and lower.
Remembering that connection to the
inhale
and that release that you're able to
gift yourself through the exhale,
holding here as you go inward. One more
time.
Inhale
and exhale.
Let's slowly come to center. reaching
your arms back up and take a gentle
twist. Placing your left hand onto your
right knee, looking over your right
shoulder and then even possibly slightly
leaning towards the left. Noticing the
different positions of your body and how
they trigger a different physical
response. Maybe a gentle lean, maybe a
deeper lean, whatever feels nice for
you. Just play with it a little bit.
Then switch. Same thing to the other
side. Other hand to the knee. and then
reach and lean back as you continue to
take this nice twist. Inhale
and exhale.
Let it go. Come back to that neutral
center position.
And then lift your knees, cross your
ankles, wherever is comfortable. Come
back into your easy pose. reaching the
arms back up, bending your elbows, and
just placing the hands back over to that
forehead, third eye,
hauling in energy of divine guidance,
support,
and light from the unseen beings that
surround you and protect you at all
times. And then slowly on your next
breath bringing your hands over towards
your throat right in front of your face.
Connecting to this intuition, this
wisdom that you always hold within this
space of your body, of your psyche, of
your energetic field.
Connecting to the energy of your throat
chakra.
Calling in guidance, strength, and
protection.
allowing yourself to speak your truth
to step forth with courage,
awareness, and love.
Reminding yourself the power that you
hold through the use of your words.
And then thirdly, placing your hands
over to your heart. That center
connection of your soul, of your divine
energy, of your cosmic connection to the
universe, falling in gratitude for this
incredible practice for your body, for
your health, and for your life.
To close off this practice, let's take
one last big breath together. Reaching
your arms up to the sky one more time.
And then releasing in a big bow to the
earth, thanking yourself, thanking this
opportunity that you've gifted yourself
to practice connection, self-love, and
self-compassion. From my heart to yours,
thank you so much for flowing with me
today. I send you all my love and light.
Namaste.

[Music]
Welcome to Costa Rica. We are here today
on another beautiful beach with a yoga
practice dedicated to releasing sore
muscles and tension.
This 15-minute practice will focus on
gentle movements and deep breathing to
help soothe tired muscles and release
built-up tension and soreness in the
body. Through mindful awareness and
deliberate relaxation, we'll work
towards creating space and ease within
our bodies and minds. So, if you're
ready to begin your journey towards
greater relaxation and rejuvenation,
then grab your mat and let's begin.
[Music]
Thought that we could stay the same.
Find a way through night and rain.
[Music]
Thank you so much for joining me here
today for this practice.
We're going to begin by simply finding a
comfortable seated position on your mat
with your feet crossed in front of you.
Right foot in front of your left.
Breathing deeply.
Allowing your shoulders to drop and
relax.
Just taking this opportunity to settle
into the body and then taking your arms
up to the sky. Your next breath in and
exhale reaching towards the right.
So right hand down, left arm reaches up
to the sky
and all the way to the side of your mat.
Being very mindful that both of your
sitbones are staying grounded.
Just breathe in
and exhale out. Go ahead and bend your
top elbow now. Place your hand behind
your head and then bring that elbow to
the opposite knee and open for one. So
you slightly round the spine and bring
that elbow to knee and then open for
two.
Over and open for three. One more time.
and open. Hold here.
Keep pointing that elbow up to the sky.
Deep breath in.
[Music]
Lengthening through the side body. And
then back to center. All right. Now
extend your right leg. The foot that was
in front is going to extend all the way
out.
Right arm reaches up to the sky. And
then place the forearm onto the mat in
front of your leg. And then from here
continuing to open perhaps reaching now
your hand and fingers towards that foot.
Deepening again that sensation of length
and stretch through the side of your
body.
Breathing into your intercostal muscles.
So the muscles in between your ribs.
Keeping both sitbones grounded. Take one
more breath in.
Go a little further if you can and
exhale.
Slowly, we're going to release and come
back up to seated.
[Music]
From here, the knee that's bent is going
to come up to your chest. You're going
to pivot so you're facing towards that
extended leg. Crossing your left leg on
top, stacking your knees into a single
shoelace position. Take your exhale and
just release body down. Inhale up.
Exhale lower. So only three times. So
one more. Inhale extend through the
spine. And then exhale release. So now
you want to think about forehead to that
left knee. Your hands staying on the mat
or even underneath your extended leg.
And really focusing on feeling that
sensation not only in your hamstring but
also slightly through your glute muscle
as well.
Since our bodies are so interconnected,
it's very normal to feel the stretch
refer all the way up through your sacrum
into your lower back as well. So if
that's happening to you, just breathe
through it. Know it's normal.
Another inhale and exhale. Let's go
ahead and bring our body up. Now take
your foot that's closest to you and grab
it with both hands. Bend your knee. So
the left knee into the body and then
with your exhalation and begin to extend
the leg for one. So we bend and slightly
round in the upper back and then extend.
Look up to the sky and extend that knee
for two. Bring it in and extend for
three. And one more time. Bring it in.
Extend for four. Hold it here.
Breathing deeply.
Inhale.
Exhale out
back to center.
Bend your knee.
And then from this position, just extend
both legs and come back to seated. This
time, left foot in front of your right.
Repeating the same sequence but to the
other side. Inhale, reach up. And then
exhale, take your side stretch over to
the left. So, left hand down, right arm
reaches overhead. Just breathe and
lengthen through the side body.
Sitbones are grounded.
Find that breath. Inhale.
[Music]
And exhale.
Hand comes behind your head. Elbow bent.
Now bring it in for one. And open up.
Elbow to opposite knee for two. Then
open. Noticing the different sensations
through the back and hips that happen
here as you slightly turn and switch the
angle of your body. One more time.
And open. Let's hold it here. Inhale.
Exhale. Go a little bit deeper if you
can.
And then come back to center.
Extending that front foot. So your left
leg now reaches out to the side. Elbow
or forearm to the inside of your leg.
And extend that other arm. Reach and
breathe.
So same thing really focusing on paying
attention to the alignment of your body
here. So make sure both of your sitbones
are grounded. You reach, you breathe and
expand through the upper body
with your exhale. Relax into the
posture.
[Music]
Inhale
and exhale.
[Laughter]
[Music]
Returning back to center.
Bring your knee up and then cross it
over top. So now stacking right knee
over left.
Hands underneath. Inhale and exhale.
Release it down for one.
Inhale open. Exhale release into that
single shoelace for two.
Inhale open.
Exhale release for three.
And now we hold
allowing your forehead to relax towards
that knee. Paying attention to every
sensation that arises here.
Following the movement of your breath,
letting go with each exhalation.
[Music]
[Music]
Wonderful. Now, from here, let's slowly
lift our body. We're going to take that
foot that's closest to you and grab it
with both of your hands along the
outsides of the foot. Extend the knee.
Extend your back. Look up to the sky.
And then bend your knees slightly round
for one.
Extend and open.
and bring it in for two.
Extend and open.
And three. And one more time. Extend and
open.
Hold it here. Now
breathe deeply.
Lengthening through the spine.
Really focusing on this openness,
spaciousness within your body.
Then return your gaze to center whenever
you like. Drop your leg and then simply
just scoot down along your mat and come
into a reversed upward plank by simply
lifting your hips and opening the chest.
And then drop your hips down, flex both
feet. Inhale, reach both arms up. And
then exhale. Take your seated forward
fold. Releasing your body all the way
down towards your knees.
Just breathing deeply. Inhale.
Exhale out. Feel free to open up the
legs a little wider if that feels better
for your body.
Remember, you can always adjust and
modify every single posture here today
to suit your needs.
So inhale
and exhale.
Come back up. Bring your feet together
if they're not. Hands behind your back.
Press into the hands as you lift your
hips. Squeeze your glutes. Throw your
head back. And then bend your knees.
Scoot forward with your hips. And now
take our butterfly. Placing the feet
together. Knees apart. Inhale. Open your
chest.
Exhale. come forward. So once again just
adding a little bit of movement here
to come down and again inhale open.
Exhale down.
And now we hold.
So once again let's focus on that
breath. Allow the breath to be the
guiding force here of this practice.
Inhaling deeply
and exhaling softly.
Inhale.
Come on up to seated.
Bring your knees together. And just a
windshield wipe side to side.
Letting go of any tension here in the
hips.
and then cross your feet in front of you
and meet me on your hands and knees
position on your mat.
Great. From here, just check your
alignment. Take a deep breath in. Tuck
your toes behind you. Then as you
exhale, lift your hips, but keep your
knees bent in a downward-facing dog
position. A few times here where we just
tap the knees to the ground and then
push back or two. Really focusing on
that extension and opening through the
upper body.
Good. Feel that lengthening sensation.
And then once you're ready, extend your
knees one at a time. Maybe walk it out
on the spot. Do whatever feels good for
your legs here for your upper back.
Moving your hips if you need to. Or
maybe even just finding stillness and
holding your downward dog. Whatever
feels good for you. Take that now.
[Music]
And then from here, we're just going to
land back in our downward-f facing dog.
Find your center. And just breathe.
Inhaling deeply,
exhaling softly.
[Music]
Then lift your heels. And then step your
left foot to the front of your mat. Drop
your right knee into our low lunge. Take
a deep breath in.
Just allow the hips to fall down. So you
feel this lengthening sensation through
the hip flexor and then come up a little
higher. What we're going to do is a
different variation of a low lunge, but
this time I want you to tuck that
tailbone under. It's almost like you
bring your weight back, hands on the
front knee, and just bring the chin to
the chest.
So, it's less about letting the hips
come down to the mat, but it's more
about just rounding through the upper
back while still pushing the hips
forward slightly. So, you feel a
different part of your soaz, your hip
flexor being affected here. And again,
just pay attention to everything that
arises,
finding your breath. And then on your
exhale, just dive back down with your
hips into that deeper low lunge. If you
can noticing the difference here between
the two versions.
Inhale.
Now exhale. Hands come back down. Walk
your left foot to the right side of your
mat. Drop your left knee down. And then
bend your back knee and just land onto
that left hip. So we're making more of a
angled position. So both knees are bent
at about 45°.
Come down onto your elbows.
And just notice how this feels on your
glute. So it is a pigeon pose, but it's
a slightly different variation. Much
more easier than the full pigeon,
but it also targets a different point
through the glute. So play with it a
little bit. If you don't feel it,
readjust. Maybe you need to go into a
full pigeon, and that's fine, too.
Just play with your own body, noticing
what angle feels the best for you right
now.
Now, when you're ready to come out, do
come into a full pigeon if that's
possible for you today. And then meet me
back in downward-facing dog. Inhale.
Exhale. Go deep. Come through into
upward dog by just dropping your hips
all the way down. Lift your thighs off
the floor. Open through your chest.
And then push back downward-facing dog.
Now from here, let's step your other
foot, your right foot towards the front
of your mat in between your hands. Drop
your left knee down.
Good. Just find a moment to find your
breath.
And then let's bring our body up and
find that higher variation of that low
lunge. So shift your weight back. Maybe
even bring the front foot slightly
towards the midline.
Hands onto that front knee. Chin down.
Tuck the tailbone under. And then just
try to round through the upper back only
noticing the different sensations that
arise here
and play with it. If you need to drop
your hips down for a moment and then
come back up just to see the difference
or the variation of the different
muscles affected by this particular
posture.
So let's come down now with the hips.
You can test it out here if you need to
or just stay low. Deep breath in.
This should feel more lengthening
through more of the thigh as well. Hands
back down onto the mat.
And then shift your foot to the left
side of your mat. Drop your right knee
to the right. Bend your back knee about
45°.
And then from here, just walk down to
your elbows. So pigeon pose, but
modified version. So, we're more on the
right hip,
but still noticing if how that slight
shift of the weight targets a different
part of your glute. It's very normal to
also feel this through the IT band as
well. So, if you're very sore and tight
in your IT bands, this might feel really
amazing for you. But again, listen to
your body. If you need to come into a
full pigeon because that targets your
glute deeper, then please go ahead and
do so.
Wonderful. Well, now from here, let's
come on up. Tuck your back toes,
square the hips,
push into the hands, and step back.
Downward-facing dog.
Inhale.
Exhale out. Just let it go.
Inhale.
And then when you're ready, exhale. Lift
the heels. Bend your knees. Come down to
your knees.
Sit back into child's pose. Forehead
down.
Good. And just resting here for a moment
to close off this gentle practice today.
When you're ready to come out, push into
the floor and come up to seated. Knees
together, feet together.
Let's take a final deep breath in and
reach both arms up to the sky.
and then exhale. Hands over to your
heart.
Just taking this opportunity to thank
yourself for your wonderful quick but
rejuvenating practice. Thanks so much
for joining me here in Costa Rica. I
look forward to seeing you again our
next class. Thank you. Namaste.

[music]
Heat. Heat.
[music]
Welcome to beautiful Iceland. We are
here today on a magical black sand beach
with another yoga workout practice which
is part of the inner warrior yoga
series. In today's practice, we will be
focusing on mobility, bringing more
freedom and fluid movement into your
joints through a [music] series of
targeted exercises and yoga postures,
which will be all about building
strength, control, [music] and a deeper
connection to your body and your mind.
So, if you're ready to get started, grab
your mat and let's begin.
>> [music]
>> Thank you so much for joining me here
today for this practice.
We're going to get started by finding a
[music] comfortable seated position
along the back of your mat. We're going
to come into child's pose. Bringing your
feet together. Feel free to keep your
knees apart and allow your body to
release forward. Allowing your head to
rest on the mat, forehead [music] down.
Go ahead and just take this moment to
close your eyes. Coming in softly into
your breath.
Taking a deep breath in.
And then as you exhale, making a tent
with both of your fingers, extending
through the elbows, and then [music]
bending the elbows as you come down.
Inhaling, moving with the breath. Then
exhale, bring your forehead down.
Inhale, reach up. Exhale, [music]
release. Reach your arms to the front of
your mat. And at this time, go ahead and
come over into all fours position.
Inhaling, arching the back into cat cow.
And then exhale, rounding the spine.
Inhale, look up. Exhale, round and
release.
Inhale, look up.
Exhale, release.
Inhale, arch the back. Look up.
Exhale, let it go. Now, let's add some
movement into the spine by making a
circle with your hips, with your
shoulders, with your back.
Making a nice circular motion here with
the spine. And then reverse the
direction. Same thing.
Feeling where the tension lies, where
you need a little bit more space, a
little bit more movement and mobility.
Great. And then coming into neutral
position when you're done,
pulling your navl into the spine.
[music] And let's begin by extending now
your left leg behind you. Shoulders
directly over top of your wrist. Pull
your core together, navl to spine. From
here, all we're going to do is start to
bring the leg out to the side, [music]
either to the corner all the way, and
then bring it back around. Now, don't
worry if you lose height [music] in the
leg. It's not the point to keep the
height. It's just to start to include a
little bit of that rotational movement
into the hip joint.
Bring it around [music] and back behind
you. While at the same time, we're
starting to target your glute muscles,
toning and strengthening that part of
your body.
Bring it over to the side [music]
and then bend your knee and start to
pulse up. Two, three, to the side. 4 5 6
7 8 9 10. Bring it around now with the
bent knee. And all we're going to do is
just bring it to the side and back
around with your knee bent. Once again,
targeting the hip mobility [music] while
also giving your body an opportunity to
strengthen and tone your glute muscles
from different direction.
Bring it around and back. Bring it
around [music]
and back. So thinking that knee towards
your shoulder and then back to that
center position
and back [music]
and back. Wonderful. Hold it here and
just pulse it back. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. You
got 10 more pulses. 10 9 8 7 [music] 6 5
4 3 2 1 Beautiful. Hold it here. Extend
your leg. And then drop it down. Lift
the other heel and pivot on that
supported knee and come into a nice side
stretch [music] on your knee. Holding
here for a moment. Just giving it a nice
release.
And then once you're ready from here,
we're going to go into our next
exercise. Candlestick dipper. You're
going to bring your hands behind your
head. You're going to dip to the side
and then use the strength of your
oblique muscles to bring it back up. So,
lengthening [music] through the oblique
and then contracting it
and up. Very nice. Bring it out and up.
[music] Bring it down. Up. Now, next one
you're going to come down. Hold here.
That top elbow is going to come in,
open, and then back to center. Lower.
Close the elbow open and back [music] to
center. So, it's a little bit of a twist
here.
Again, targeting different areas of your
obliques [music] while also giving you
opportunity to stretch and release along
the side body here. Twist, [music]
open, center. Reach,
open, center. Very good. And again.
Reach, twist, open center.
Reach. Hold. Extend your arms. Bring
your way back into that supported knee.
Hold. And give yourself a nice stretch.
From here, transitioning into a full
side plank. See if you can stack your
feet on top of one another. Hold here.
Find that balance, that strength. Find
your breath. Inhale.
Exhale. Bend that top knee. Bring it
towards the back. And opening into your
wild thing. [music]
lifting from your hips and your chest,
opening that heart center.
Awesome. And then come back into side
plank. Inhale.
Exhale back into full plank. [music]
Deep breath in.
Exhale to just pulse it forward and
back. 2 3 4. So just bring your weight
forward and back. 6
7 8 9 [music] 10. Hold it here. Take
your chaturanga dandasana.
Release all the way down onto your
belly. Let's take a cobra lift. Lift up,
pressing into [music] the hands, and
bring your forehead down. So, keeping
your hips firmly on the mat. We're just
working on lifting your heart and chest
off the mat, strengthening your back
muscles and creating a little bit more
space and mobility in the spine. [music]
Push into the floor. Lift
and lower. One more time. Press into
your hands.
Use the strength of your back muscles.
Now [music] extend your arms. Reach
forward. Full locus position. But you're
going to bend your elbows and squeeze
the shoulder blades together. [music]
and then release down. Both legs and
arms come up as you row your arms back
and [music] squeeze the shoulder blades
together and release. Lift and squeeze
the shoulder blades together. Release.
Exhale. Lift and squeeze.
And lower.
And again. Squeeze and hold. Lower.
Squeeze.
And lower.
Squeeze
and lower.
Squeeze and lower. A few more times, my
friends. Lift and hold.
Now extend your arms forward and give me
little swims. Move your arms and legs at
the same [music] time. Go. 15 seconds.
Just keep going. Move your arms and
legs. Swim. Swim. Just keep swimming.
Keep going. Keep going.
And then release. Arms right next to
your body. Legs are down. Press into the
hands coming into a full upward-facing
dog. Lift your thighs off the mat.
Release the toes. And let's come into
our first downward-facing dog.
[music] Giving yourself a moment to
release any tension you may feel along
the back of your legs and your
shoulders. Make sure your fingers are
spread wide. And with each exhalation,
allow the heels to come closer down
towards the mat. Wonderful. From here,
let's transition into a high plank
position and take your chaturanga
upward-facing dog. Inhale.
Exhale. Bend your knees. And let's
release into child's [music] pose.
Inhale.
And then exhale. Roll forward. All fours
position. Let's take it to the other
side. So the other leg extends. Now your
right leg. Pull navl into spine. Find
that connection to your core.
We're going to start with a side kick
and then bring it back to center.
[music] Bring the leg to the side and
center. So, of course, the challenge
here is to not allow the hip to come up
too high. And that's okay if you lose
the height of your back leg. What really
matters is that we start to incorporate
a little bit more movement along the hip
joint of [music] the femur bone inside
your hip.
Good. Now bend your knee and pulse the
knee to the side.
3 4 5 6 [music] 7 8 9 10. Keep the knee
bent. Hold. Now bring it to the back.
Bring it to the side. [music]
Back and side. Very good. Back and side.
Back and side. Back and side. Back and
side. You got this.
[music]
Side [music]
and back. And now let's pulse.
[music] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. More. 10 9 8
7 6 5 4 3 2 1. Hold it here. Extend your
[music] leg. Drop it down. Now lift the
bottom foot off the mat. You're going to
pivot on that supported knee. And then
open into a nice side stretch, reaching
your arm all the way to the front of
your mat. Bring yourself [music] a nice
stretch. Now stay there. I'm just going
to do a quick little flip over so
[music] I can face you and you can watch
me from the front.
Good. Let's hold for another breath in
and then exhale. Let's bring oursel
right up. We're going to take our
candlestick dipper. [music] Now, first I
want you to really think of that
tailbone pointing down towards the
bottom of your mat. Hold your navl to
the spine. Reach and bring it up [music]
for one. Reach as far as you can and
then come up for two. Use those side
obliques to do all the work for you.
Bring it out and [music] center. Bring
it out and center. All the way to the
side. Now close. Take a little twist
[music] and back to center. Reach over.
A little twist.
Open [music]
and center.
Reach. Twist.
Open and center. [music]
Reach. Twist.
Open and center. [music]
And again. Reach to the side. A little
twist. Open. Back [music] to center.
Reach.
Open center.
Beautiful. Twist. Open [music] center.
Awesome. Release the hand. And give
yourself one more deep stretch if you
can,
creating lots of space through the
vertebraes, through the intercostal
[music]
muscles of your rib cage. And then stack
your feet together and take your high
side plank.
Making sure that your limbs are stacked,
bend the top knee. And then bring the
foot behind you. Opening into a wild
thing. Lifting from your hips, from your
heart center, all the way up to the sky.
Feel that nice stretch.
And then slowly from here, return, we're
turning back into side plank.
And then repositioning ourselves into
high plank. So I'm just going to turn
around to make sure we're on the same
side here. So when you're [music] ready
to transition, your top hand is going to
come down.
Hold your plank, shoulders above your
wrists, and all we're going to do is
take a little reach and back. So you
come out [music] to the tippy toes and
back 10 times. We're just pulsing
forward and back. Creating a little bit
more of a challenge for your [music]
stability, for your core, for the
strength of your wrists. And [music]
then taking your chaturanga, releasing,
opening into upward-facing dog.
And exhale, take it back into
downward-facing dog. [music] Release and
relax. Hold your downward-f facing dog.
Welcoming a deep inhalation.
Lift the heels. Bend your knees. And as
you [music] exhale, we're going to jump
to the front of your mat. Inhale,
halfway lift.
Exhale, come into your forward fold.
Taking this moment to just walk it out
on the spot, letting go of any tension
you might feel along the hamstrings,
bending one knee at a time.
[music]
And then when you're ready, come up
halfway.
Exhale. Step your right leg to the back
of your mat. Opening into crescent high
lunge. Hold here. Find your breath, your
center. Hands come back down. Step
forward. Forward fold. Inhale halfway.
Exhale. Step the opposite foot back.
Crescent lunge. Opening both arms up to
[music] the sky.
And release your hands. Step forward.
Forward fold. Inhale halfway. Exhale.
One more time. Step your right leg back.
Reach your arms up.
Hold it here. And from here, we're going
to take our lunge squats. All I need to
do is extend the front knee and then
bend both knees. One
and two and three
and four. You got this. 5

position. Navl to spine. Take your flow.
Chaturanga.
Upward-facing dog.
And exhale. Releasing into your
downward-facing dog. Holding here for a
moment. Giving yourself another moment
to release any tension or constriction
along the back of your legs. Lift the
heels, bend your knees, and then jump to
the front of your mat. [music] Once
again, inhale halfway. Exhale, forward
fold. And then see if you can grab your
two big toes with your piece fingers and
allow yourself to go into a deeper
forward fold. [music]
Now, if you like to open up your feet
slightly, maybe about fist length apart,
then that will work.
Release the hands [music]
slowly. From here, we're going to bend
both knees and come into a chair
position. Now, once again, you can keep
your feet slightly apart. Inhale,

hamstrings while at the same time
strengthening [music] our quadriceps.
Extend. Bring your arms forward and to
the back.
Bring it forward [music] to the back and
bring it forward to the back. You got

can grab your ankles. This time bringing
your forehead as close to your knees as
possible. Inhale halfway. Bring your
hands to the mat. And then exhale, step
your feet out, heel toe until you can
come into your molassa yogic squat. Toes
pointed away from you. Use your elbows.

floor. Release your feet and come all
the way down into your child's pose.
Inhale
and exhale. Just giving a moment to
close off the practice.
Come on up to your seated position on
your heels.
And once you're ready, go ahead and just
find one deep breath in as you reach the
arms up to the sky.
And then exhale, bending your elbows,
bring your hands [music] over to your
heart center, closing your eyes, and
just giving yourself a moment of
gratitude for your practice, for your
dedication to your health and your
well-being. Thank you. Namaste.

Stillness if you need
to and using this opportunity as we hold

[Music]
hello my friends Welcome to our Pilates
lower body tone and sculpt class so
today's going to be a lower body focus
practice we're going to be using only
our body weight it'll be mat based but
it'll be a nice burn now like I
mentioned you don't need anything but
your water we're going to focus on
toning and strengthening our glutes our
quads and even a little bit into the
calf muscles as well so when you're
ready let us begin
let's get started today by coming over
to the back of your mat we're going to
start in child's pose to just give your
body an opportunity to enter into the
space into your own body kind of Center
your
mind and prepare yourself for a
beautiful challenge that's about to be
welcomed so go ahead and close your eyes
take a deep breath
in and exhale
out inhale
again and exhale
out good just coming into your
body checking in with how you're feeling
right now how's your back your shoulders
just welcome that
breath and with your exhalation let go
of everything you have to do before this
and everything you have to do after and
just welcome yourself into the present
moment focusing on our body focusing on
the control stability and strength that
we're going to
build go ahead and take another deep
breath
in then exhale let's slowly start to
roll up vertebra by vertebra coming up
to all fource position and we're going
to begin by first engaging through the
core so I want you to take your hand and
just place it onto your belly then I
want you to relax your belly just kind
of let it d uh drip or drop a little bit
now from here take an inhale and then
exhale I want you to take your belly
button and start to pull it towards your
lower back and you'll even feel your
back slightly realign so you engage here
and then your ribs are going to connect
together so we're engaging through this
whole core set your core Center from
here now we're going to extend your left
leg out to start with and then drop your
left hip down so your left and right hip
are aligned pull the navl into the
spine good and then from this position
we're going to extend your opposite arm
your right arm now we're not going to do
anything but find that stability and
strength first so reaching your right
fingertips
forward left leg extends now your goal
is to avoid this Teeter tottering motion
and you want to just find that Stillness
engag through the core
Center inhale on your exhale I'd like
you to open your right arm just slightly
to the right diagonal left leg to the
left
diagonal inhale come back to
Center exhale open slightly good so
we're moving the arm and leg to a slight
different direction while maintaining
our core our
stability our Stillness in the mid body
inhale come to Center

hand down onto the mat from here you're
just going to turn and drop your left
leg tap the right back corner of your
mat then you're going to kick it up and
with control tap the left corner lift
and tap lift and tap that's it so
starting to get a little bit more into
the glute area here we are going to
fatigue all those muscles today my
friends so just prepare yourself and
remember to stay with your breath this
is how we gain strength is by exhausting
the muscles and then building it up so
stay with your breath the whole time
even when it gets a little bit
challenging you're doing the work that's
why we're here all right tap lift tap
lift tap lift tap last
two and
one all controlled hold it here find
that balance now bend your knee and
you're just G to cross behind the right
knee then you're G to lift from your
glute and give me a nice big circle with
that knee bring it back up so you cross
lift and circle and cross lift Circle
inward lift cross Circle inward so
getting a little more into the hip
mobility here at the same time as
challenging our glutes now it's also
normal to feel in that other glute as
well you're supporting holding your body
so it's totally normal to feel it on
both
sides good breathing
here exhale last
two and circle
one bring it circle now lift that left
knee flex your left foot hold find your
balance and just Pump It 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 8
9 10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 one you're going
to lower the left knee and then you're
going to kick it back for one so you're
either going to stay here I'm going to
give you guys one variation quite more
intense and challenging just for any of
you guys that are really looking to fire
it up today so to do the variation
that's a little more challenging is to
actually hover in a bare stance and just
work the leg so you push and you bring
it in push bring it in so your call
either keep the knee down or hover it
out exhale push I'm going to try to
hover push myself today so we're in it
together my friends it's a short class
only 20 minutes and we're going to work
and sculpt that lower body good last
two one beautiful extend your left leg
don't drop it make sure you're squaring
off those hips maybe shift your weight a
little bit to the left hand if you are
feeling this intensely in the right side
release the back toes if they were
tucked under hold and breathe for four
don't let that leg drop three 2 one
bring the knee in step your left foot to

onto your hips tuck your back toes and
all I want you to do is just to lift
extend both knees and then exhale lower
and hover the bottom knee lift and
extend and lower just a set of
10 and then we're going to do something
a little bit more fancy here a little
bit more fun extend and in now I know
this seems like this is just a basic
lunge squat but I want you to think
about that core connection I want you to
think about the control in your body
it's not about the speed not about how
many you can do it's about how you can
stay aligned
connected to your breath hovering that
back knee as it comes down beautiful now
last one hold it here now you're going
to take your arms extend them out to the
side extend your back knee and lower
your heart to the front knee and then

[music]
Heat. Heat.
[music]
>> [music]
>> Welcome to Barbados.
We are here today amidst the beautiful
jungle ruins with a feel-good yoga flow
designed to awaken your breath, [music]
soften your heart, and welcome in a
renewed sense of hope.
As we move together, let each inhale be
an invitation, [music]
an opening to possibility, and let each
exhale be a release, a release of doubt,
of heaviness, [music] or anything that
no longer serves you. This is your time
to reconnect, [music] to return to your
center, and to open to the beauty that
still lies ahead. [music] So, let your
breath guide you. Let your heart lead
the way. The universe is always
offering. And this practice is about
remembering how to receive. [music]
[music]
[music]
[music]
So once you've got everything you need,
grab your [music] mat and let's begin.
Welcome my friends. Thank [music] you so
much for joining me here today for this
practice.
We're going to get started by simply
finding a comfortable seated position
along the back of your mat. Coming into
a hero's pose and then from here go
ahead and place both of your hands on
top of your heart.
Close your eyes and let's just begin
this practice by tuning in into our
body.
tuning into our heart.
Just feeling that energy within you as
you inhale
and exhale out.
And just taking a moment and putting a
little smile on your [music] face, a
gesture of hope and love and openness
into this world.
When you're ready, interlace your
fingers and place them behind your back
as you extend through the elbows and
open through the chest.
Inhale. And then as you exhale, leading
with your heart, go ahead and rest your
forehead onto the mat as your [music]
knuckles point all the way up to the
sky.
Come back [music] up.
Inhale.
And then as you exhale, back down.
Forehead to the mat. Arms up. Beautiful.
Feel free to keep your eyes closed here.
So, you just keep your connection
internally.
Open back out. Allow those [music]
knuckles to drop down to the floor as
you reach your arms up. Inhale. And then
exhale, releasing into child's pose,
resting your forehead on the mat,
fingertips reaching to the front of your
mat as you roll forward vertebrae by
vertebra. and then push your weight all
the way back into child's pose. So, just
taking this nice gentle spinal roll by
keeping the knees grounded to start
and bring it back.
Round forward your head and chin comes
up last
and then see if you can lift your thighs
and knees off the mat at this time.
Upward-facing [music]
dog. Hold it here. Exhale. Bend both
knees and release into child's pose.
Forehead down.
Inhale. Roll forward. Lift through the
knees and thighs.
Exhale. Release. Forehead all the way
down. And again, lift up. Lift your
knees and thighs. Open up through the
chest.
And exhale. From here, make sure your
shoulders are away from the ears. Lift
your hips up. Release the feet into
downward-facing dog.
Finding your alignment.
Dropping your shoulders away from the
ears. Fingers are spread wide.
Deep breath in
and exhale. Let it go. Find your breath.
Allow those heels to drop down to the
floor.
Inhale again.
Exhale. Let it go. Now on your next
breath, go ahead and lift your heels,
come up to your tippy [music] toes, and
then bring the feet together. Slowly
begin to roll forward into high plank.
And then release back into downward dog
with your feet together. [music]
Trying to make a wave like motion with
your spine.
Roll vertebrae by vertebra forward.
And then exhale back into
downward-facing dog.
and right back into your plank
and release.
Coming back into plank one more time.
And then from here, I'd like you to
hold. Really think about that
engagement. Pulling your navl into your
spine. Shoulders right above your
wrists.
Deep breath in.
Exhale. Chaturanga dandasana.
Inhale. Let's open up into upward-f
facing dog.
And then [music] as you exhale, I'd like
you to press your weight into your
hands, bend your knees, and release back
into child's pose. Sinking all the way
back to your heels, resting your
forehead on the mat. Slowly roll up to
your knees. Reach your arms up. And then
exhale, take a single arm camel. So one
hand is going to reach to the heel, the
other arm reaches above. Come back to
center.
Same thing to the other side. Looking
over to the other side or [music] up to
the sky
and returning back to center.
Look back. Bend your elbows
and then slowly release back into
[music] child's pose.
Wave like motion again, but this time
stay on your knees as you come forward
and back into child's pose. Round
through the spine.
forward and back. Trying to make the
motion as fluid as possible, opening
into upward-f facing dog. And then
exhale, releasing into your
downward-facing dog. Beautiful. Inhale
and exhale,
finding your breath, reaching now your
right leg up, and then bring your right
knee [music] to your chest. and then
extend. Release back into
downward-facing dog. Other side. Left
knee to chest.
And [music] step back into downward dog
again. [music] This time, see if you can
tap the mat with the knee. Step back
downward dog. And then other side. Tap
the mat back into downward dog. If you
want [music] to take the first variation
and just bring your knee to chest,
that's an option. or continue with the
taps.
Bring it in, tap, and back into
downward-f [music] facing dog. So,
building a little bit of heat in the
core. Now, step your right foot to the
front of your mat. Drop your left knee
and let's reach your arms up to the sky.
Low lunge.
Now stay in your low lunge, but this
time we're going to make a lotus hand
mudra by connecting your two [music]
thumbs together and your pinkies
together, creating this beautiful lotus
flower as the elbows come together as
well. See if you can look [music] up to
the sky. And then extend your arms as
you keep that [music] lotus flower
receiving beautiful energy. Opening the
hands, maybe [music] keeping the thumbs
together. and then bending your elbows
as you continue to open your heart
center, opening yourself up as you
release the hands. And then place your
hands onto the mat as you sink back into
half split, flexing your front foot,
adding some beautiful movement as you
come forward and push back, flexing the
front foot. Inhale, come forward.
Exhale, push back.

============================================================

Heat. Heat.
Welcome to beautiful Barbados.
We are here today in a magical jungle
with a soothing yoga practice for the
body and your soul.
Today's class will create a space for
deep nourishment, a gentle and peaceful
practice here to reconnect you with your
inner truth, your own heart, and the
wisdom that already lives within you.
As we move slowly and mindfully through
this practice, I invite you to soften,
to listen, and to call in divine
assistance, whatever that means for you.
Let today's practice be your sanctuary,
a sacred time to return home to
yourself, to feel, to trust, and to
remember the quiet power that lives
within.
So with that, let's begin.
Thank you so much for joining me here
today for this practice.
We're going to get started by simply
finding a comfortable seated position
along the center of your mat, feet
crossed in front of you. Go ahead and
just take a couple of deep breaths,
closing your eyes, maybe gently moving
your hands up and down your thighs and
simply arriving in this moment.
Giving yourself an opportunity to simply
return to your body.
Adding a head roll now to the right with
your eyes closed. Starting to bring all
of that awareness internally.
Noticing the sensations in your neck.
Feel free to add a little bit more
movement with the shoulders if that is
feeling good or perhaps even the body.
Making a nice big circle.
Again, keeping your eyes closed, I want
you to start to feel the sensations from
within,
moving your body in this circular
motion.
and then simply reverse the motion. You
can start by taking a head roll,
taking it over to the left
and then gently adding a little bit more
movement of the body by including the
shoulders.
And then if you're up for it, you can
include the entire torso of your body,
making nice big circles,
connecting to your breath.
Noticing how you're feeling,
how you choose to arrive today.
Nice big circle.
Beautiful. And then coming over to
center. Taking a deep breath in and
reaching both of your arms up to the
sky. Lengthening through the whole
spine. With the palms together, begin to
bring the energy down towards your face.
And then start to rub the palms of your
hands together as fast as you can.
Creating a little bit of heat, a little
bit of friction here in between your
hands.
And then placing both of your hands on
top of your eyes, on top of your face.
Just noticing this energy reaching
towards your eyes and then your ears.
And then slowly bringing both hands onto
your heart center.
Just feel that energy, that heat you've
created pierce through your body, giving
you that moment of heat connection.
Then once you're ready, let's move
forward over to our all fours position
on our mat. We're just going to start to
move a little bit more the body.
So beginning by moving the hips and the
back in a circular motion. Feel free to
bend your elbows.
Once again, I invite you to make this
movement as big or as small as you like.
You can come all the way down with the
hips and release into child's pose. Or
you can just make this small movement of
your spine. Whatever feels good for your
body is what you're going to take today.
This practice is your practice.
Same thing. Just reverse the circle now.
Whatever direction, whatever movement
you took, just start to circle the body.
Make it as big or as small as you feel
called to do.
The important thing here is just to
connect to our physical body. Feeling
the movement of your joints, your hips,
your shoulders, your back, your muscles,
awakening the body, connecting to it.
And then sit back over to your heels
into child's pose, reaching your
fingertips to the front of your mat,
resting your forehead on the floor. And
just breathe,
finding your breath. Inhale.
Then as you exhale, roll forward onto
all fours,
tuck your toes, and then from here, go
ahead and lift your hips up into a
downward-facing dog. But we're going to
keep the knees bent, giving your body
that time and proper nourishment
by taking your time in the extension of
the knees. If you want to walk out your
downward dog, feel free to do so. Or you
can just find stillness and hold.
Wherever you are is perfect. Just find
your breath,
welcoming fresh oxygen into your body
and then bending the knees back down
onto your child's pose.
Inhale with your toes staying curled
under. Exhale, start to move forward
like a body wave coming into an
upward-facing dog. Lifting through the
knees and thighs, opening through the
chest. Bend your knees and slowly come
back. Tuck your toes under and then
slowly release into downward-facing dog.
We're going to do this a few times. So,
really follow the movement of your
breath.
Bend your knees. Inhale.
Exhale. Start to roll forward vertebrae
by vertebra over towards your hands.
Allow your hips to drop. Release the
toes. Lift your thighs. Open up through
that heart center. Bend your knees. Tuck
your toes. Push back. And release.
Downward-facing dog.
Find your breath. Inhale.
Exhale. Start to walk your feet towards
the front of your mat.
Walking all the way forward.
Bend your knees. And just allow your
head to relax. Nodding your head up and
down. Nodding it yes. And then moving it
side to side. No.
Just letting go of any tension,
decompressing the spine, and then
bending your left knee, extending your
right leg, and reaching your right arm
up to the sky into a little twist here.
Breathing in. Exhale, come to center and
switch to the other side. So now the
right knee bends, left leg extends, left
arm reaches up to the sky.
If you need to use a block here, you're
more than welcome to hold on to a block
or see if you can reach the ground. Come
back to center into your forward fold.
Bend both knees and start to roll up
nice and slow,
finding your energy, your breath. Reach
both arms up to the sky.
As you exhale, begin to bring that
energy down towards your forehead, to
your third eye chakra, connecting
yourself to your intuition, to your
connection to the divine.
And then slowly continue to bring that
energy down towards your heart,
connecting the sense of intuition to
your own heart, to your own body, to
your inner self. Once you're ready,
release the arms and reach one more time
on your inhale.
Exhale. This time, bow down towards
mother earth. Bring your hands to the
floor. Inhale halfway.
Exhale. Go ahead and step your right leg
to the very back of your mat. Coming
into a high lunge position. Find your
grounding, your center. Just hold here
for a moment. Look forward. Find your
breath.
Notice your body and all the sensations.
On your next exhalation, transitioning
to a seated spinal twist by bringing
your weight to the front leg and then
bending the back knee, sinking down,
taking your right elbow towards the left
knee, and then pushing that left knee
away from you with that right elbow as
you look over your left shoulder.
Other hand stays close to your body.
really feeling that energy moving
through from the base of your spine all
the way to the crown of your head.
You're more than welcome to close your
eyes and just connect. Feel notice how
your body is feeling in this moment.
The prana that is vibrating through your
body.
Deep breath in. Exhale. Come forward.
Extend.
Reach and extend your right leg behind
you. Bend the knee. Returning back into
that high lunge. Inhale.
On your next exhalation, we're going to
extend the front knee into pyramid pose.
So, once you're ready, push back. Try to
keep your hips aligned and square to the
front of your mat.
Inhale, bend the front knee, look
forward.
Exhale, gently release back.
Inhale, bend the knee forward.
Exhale. Let's release back.
Beautiful. Inhale. Bending the front
knee. One more time. And then from here,
start to heel toe your foot towards the
midline and then the inside of your mat.
Dropping your left knee all the way
down. And start to gently just make
movements up and down with the back
foot. We're starting to bring our body
into our pigeon pose, but taking our
time, of course. Once you feel ready,
you can release all the way down.
And just close your eyes and add a
little movement here. Breathe with it.
Open your eyes to the sky, to the
energy.
Come down to your elbows if you like to
go a little bit deeper.
Placing the palms of your hands
together, resting them along the
forehead.
If you like to go all the way down,
you're more than welcome to as well. And
just remember, keeping your front foot,
your shin parallel to the front of your
mat will be very, very difficult. If you
can do it, of course, that's great, but
you don't have to. You can bring the
heel closer towards your hip, which will
make this ASA much easier on your body.
So, please adjust accordingly.
And then close your eyes and go within
noticing the sensations through the
physical body as you welcome a deeper
inhalation.
Welcoming more fresh oxygen into your
body into your heart center.
Letting go through the exhalation.
Allowing any heaviness, any negativity,
any energy that's been weighing you down
to be released through that exhale.
knowing that you are in control to
release all that no longer serves you.
It all starts in the mind
and through that choice the tension gets
released out of the body.
So make that choice to let it go.
Deep breath in
and exhale out.
Deep breath in
and exhale out.
One final deep breath.
And then when you're ready to exhale, go
ahead and slowly release your hands,
lifting up your body,
placing your hands onto the mat.
And then tuck your back toes underneath.
Push into the hands. And slowly
transition yourself into downward-f
facing dog. Giving your body a little
bit of grace by shaking it out. Moving
your knees, your legs, coming into your
downward-f facing dog. Find your deep
inhale here.
A long exhale out as you slowly
transition into high plank. And then
taking your chaturanga or drop your
knees down to the floor for modified
version.
Drop your belly and your chest onto the
mat. Slide your hands forward coming
into a baby cobra and then resting your
elbows on the mat. Opening the palms of
your hands and closing your eyes.
Drawing your shoulders down away from
the ears. I'd like you to really open
through the heart center.
Visualizing your heart opening and this
beautiful light coming out of your
heart.
opening yourself energetically
to the universe, to divine, to whichever
higher power you like to call. No matter
what name you use, I'd like you to open
yourself up to it, calling in divine
guidance, support.
Then slowly drop your head down, push
into the hands, and open a little deeper
and wider into upward-f facing dog.
Continue to keep your eyes closed if you
wish. Release back into downward-facing
dog.
Stay with your breath. Stay with your
intention. Inhale.
Exhale. Slowly start to walk your feet
to the front of your mat. Walk all the
way to the front. Release your hands.
And then slowly bend your knees and roll
up to standing. Take your time. Move
with grace and gentleness. Reach your
arms up to the sky.
And slowly exhale. Bring that energy
back down towards your third eye.
Connecting yourself to that intuitive
part of you.
Trusting that part of you.
And then bring your hands down to your
heart,
connecting to that inner wisdom, inner
knowing within you.
Opening your arms. Look up to the sky.
Take another breath in.
Reaching your arms all the way up to the
sky. And then exhale. Dive all the way
back down to the earth.
Releasing your hands onto the mat.
Inhale. Come up halfway.
Exhale. Bending both knees. This time

mat.
Just find your breath and hold. Paying
attention to all the sensations within
your body.
Inhale
and exhale.
Inhale.
Exhale. Come forward into your seated
spinal twist. Bring your opposite elbow
to your knee. Look over your right
shoulder.
making sure your other hand stays close
to the bottom of your spine.
And you think about that elongation. So
think about reaching up to the sky
through the crown of your head.
Closing your eyes once again and just
connecting to every sensation in your
body. Allowing your breath to keep you
present, to keep you here with your
heart.
Beautiful. Untwist the body. Come back
to center. Bring your weight towards
that front foot.

a couple of forward and backs with the
hip
and slowly adjusting yourself until you
can come all the way down into your
pigeon pose. Making sure the straight
back leg is along the center of your
mat. And then with your exhalation, bend
both elbows and come on down to wherever
you're comfortable. See if you can place
the palms of your hands together and
just rest your forehead down on top of
them.
Once again, just making this gesture of
gratitude, of connection to yourself
and to the divine,
connecting your energy
to that intuitive part of you,
to that inner knowing,
that wisdom that comes from the heart.
So often we question it, we doubt it.
We allow the brain, the mind to take
over.
But in so many times and instances, that
heart, that intuition is what is guiding
us, what is taking us along our path in
life.
We must learn to listen to it.
We must learn to not ignore it.
Because through this connection, this is
how we connect deeper to our inner
selves, our spirit guides,
our angels, the divine, whatever you
wish to call it. This is that channel,
that portal which allows us to connect
to it.
So in this moment, let's deepen that
connection by welcoming a deep breath
in.
Honoring yourself and your path,
honoring your body, honoring your life,
being grateful
for this beautiful life. No matter which
path it's taken, what obstacles we've
faced, it has brought us here.
And it is perfect.
exactly as it is. It is perfect.
So, welcome that deep breath.
Welcome that guidance, that support.
Know that it's always here for you.
When you're ready to release this asa,
you may bring your hands down onto your
mat.
Tuck your back toes. Push and step back.
Downward-f facing dog.
Give yourself a moment to release
to deepen the breath once again. And
then slowly transitioning back into
plank and dropping your knees down to
the mat or taking a chaturanga and
dropping your hips and your belly to the
floor. Sliding your elbows and forearms
forward. Opening the palms of your hands
coming into your sphinx pose.
Just making sure you drop those
shoulders down away from the ears. And
again visualizing that heart opening and
that beautiful vibrant light coming out
of your heart. Opening the palms of your
hands as a gesture of receal, receiving
energy, receiving guidance, strength,
protection. Whatever you seek in this
moment right now, open yourself up to
it.
Call it in
slowly. Now release. Place your hands
down and push into the hands as you open
into upward-f facing dog.
And exhale. Bend your knees.
Sink back into child's pose.
Extending your arms. Resting your
forehead on the mat. Closing your eyes
once again and just following the
breath.
Connecting to this pronic energy that is
vibrating through the inside out
energy of connection,
the energy of the stars.
Feel it vibrating, pulsating, moving
through your body as you inhale
and exhale.
Now on your next breath, let's slowly
roll up to seated. it on your heels,
just finding your center.
And then once you're ready, shifting
your weight onto one side, then swinging
your legs forward to the front of your
mat. And just take a scoot over to the
front of your mat so you have lots of
space behind you, grounding your feet.
Then place the palms of your hands in
front of you. Start to move your hands
up and down as fast as you can, just
like we did in the beginning of our
practice. Creating that heat, that
friction, that energy between the palms
of your hands. Rub, rub, rub. Then from
here, feel that heat and that energy and
just hover it above your heart as you
slowly release your body all the way
down. Keep your hands hovered. And then
with the same energy, start to push that
energy down from the heart center all
the way towards your belly, your hips.
Then allow that energy to move down to
the thighs, knees, and feet.
Just letting all that negative heavy
energy release. Placing your hands in
front of your third eye once again.
Rubbing them together. One more time.
Creating another force of heat.
And then placing one hand on your belly,
one on your heart.
Staying in the shavasana, welcoming the
practice of a three-part breath
pranayyama.
Or if you choose to simply stay in
shavasana, you may do so as well. If
you're welcoming the three-part breath,
start to inhale into your belly first
and feeling your hand of the belly rise
and then guiding that breath upward
through to your chest and your rib cage
and then all the way to your chest.
And then feel your chest release
as you exhale the air out from the
chest,
the ribs,
and then your belly.
And doing that again for as many times
as you like.
Inhaling into the belly,
the ribs, and then the chest.
and then exhaling chest,
ribs,
and then the belly.
With your eyes closed, simply feel that
energy moving through your body,
that energizing, revitalizing breath
moving into your heart,
bringing fresh blood flow, bringing
fresh energy, love, and light.
giving you strength,
giving you the power that you need
to move through your day, through your
life.
Feeling this energy of love
wrapping you up
enveloping your body in a beautiful
light.
Light of protection,
light of guidance,
support
and trust.
Trusting in your inner knowing, in your
heart.
Trusting in your path.
Knowing that you are exactly where
you're supposed to be in your life.
Every beautiful and difficult moment has
brought you here today and it is
perfect.
You are perfect just as you are.
So breathe in gratitude.
Breathe in this blessing.
Breathe in grace.
And then as you exhale,
surrender and let go all that you no
longer wish to carry.
Surrender it to this higher power. to
the universe,
to mother earth.
Give it away. Let it go.
Know that you no longer need to carry
it.
That it is here for you to be released.
So you can create space to receive all
the blessings that you deserve.
So breathe in
and breathe out
and let it go.
Now, let's welcome one more deep breath
in.
And then as you're ready to exhale,
let's start to welcome some movement
back into the body.
Gently moving your fingers and your
toes.
And then reaching your arms above your
head, giving yourself a nice big
stretch,
bending your knees.
Exhale, moving over to the side.
and then come on up to seated position
along the center of your mat. Once
again,
take your time here. Once you're
comfortable, I welcome you to keep your
eyes closed so you just keep that
connection internally
and then allow the palms of your hands
to open and just let them hover above
the knees. closing your eyes and closing
our practice here by calling in that
supportive energy. One more time,
taking a deep breath in and just feeling
this energy entering through your hands,
open yourself up to the universe,
to the divine light, divine power,
divine guidance.
Then slowly bring the palms of your
hands together in front of your heart
center.
Bring the hands in front of your third
eye. And then slowly down to your heart
with your eyes closed. Taking this
moment as a gesture of gratitude to
yourself,
gratitude for your practice, for your
dedication,
for your commitment to your own inner
connection. From my heart to yours,
thank you. Namaste. Oo.

[music]
Heat. Heat.
[music]
>> [music]
[music]
>> All right, my friends. So, [music] let's
get started today. Coming over to a
seated position on our mat. We're going
to start with our feet in front. So,
starting by placing the feet grounded.
We're going to take our hands underneath
our knees. So, let's begin by welcoming
lots of beautiful movement into the
body. So, first waking [music] up the
shoulders,
rolling the shoulders up, back, and
around.
Waking up the body here, the upper body.
Adding some neck rolls. Just rolling the
head over to the right
and around. Deepening [music] the breath
into the body.
Good. And again.
Wonderful. Coming into center. Taking a
little spinal twist. [music]
Placing hand over to your left knee.
Looking over your left shoulder.
Good. And [music] over to the other
side.
Just look over your shoulder. [music]
Think of that lengthening sensation
through the crown of your head.
Good. And then come back to center. And
now from here, I'd like you to grab your
ankles and just place them in a
butterfly position. So knees out.
And then from here, I'd like you to
close your eyes. Now I'm going to make
it up to you whether you want to hold on
to your ankles and just hold here or
place your hands onto your heart center.
As you know I'd like to start every
practice just taking a moment to connect
to our breath [music] to land in the
body. So wherever you are even if your
hands are down just take a deep [music]
breath in
and then exhale.
Just feel that exhalation coming through
your body.
With your eyes closed, pay attention to
how your body is feeling in this very
[music] moment.
How are you arriving today onto your
mat?
Where are you holding on to tension?
If you like to add a little bit of
movement into [music] this moment of
connection, you can by just circling
your body.
Today's practice is really connected
[music]
with the earth element of water.
Meaning, we're going to try to really go
through lots of fluid motions yet,
[music] of course, still strengthening
and challenging our body in many ways,
but really focusing how can we connect
[music]
movement, breath,
and stillness.
So listening to what your body is asking
of you today, moving whenever you feel
[music] guided to move or finding
stillness whenever you're seeking a
little bit more [music] of that inner
connection.
Let's take one more inhale.
Exhale.
Then opening your eyes, bringing [music]
your knees together, planting your feet
down. So we're going to start as we did
the other day where we starting with the
rollup [music] exercise. Remember, we
were holding underneath the knees today.
Let's advance it by bringing the [music]
arms forward. So, same intention, one
vertebrae at a time, but we're going to
keep the arms off the mat the whole
time. Reach the arms [music] up. Exhale.
Lift up. Don't move your feet off the
mat. That's the challenge. And then we
come down nice and slow, [music]
activating the core,
waking up the entire body. [music]
Exhale.
Come back down again.
[music] Inhale.

Last time.
Good. Nice and slow. Now reach the arms
over your head. Exhale. Bring your arms
up. Reach. Reach. Reach. Reach. Reach.

down about halfway. So again, pull that
navl to the spine. [music] You're going
to hold it here. here. Now I'd like you
to extend your left leg. Hold. Engage
through the quadricep. [music] Add a

chest.

Exhale. Extend both legs up to the sky.
Flex your feet. Maybe give the
hamstrings a little release, a little
stretch, a [music] little massage.
From this position, we're going to go
into our single-legged switches. Again,
we're activating through the core to get
the practice [music] moving. You can
either keep staying with your head down,
or if you want to take it up a notch
today, lift and reach with your arms
forward to shoulder blades off the mat.
knee to chest as the other leg extends.
[music]
Bring it all the way up. Exhale, switch

Come back to center. [music]
Hug your knees in. Double leg stretch.
So from here, I'm going to give you two
options. Option [music] one is to place
your hands underneath your sacrum. Head
down. You're just going to work the legs
for [music] me. Option two, a little bit
more challenging, is to involve the
whole body. So you [music] extend arms
over your head, legs out, bring the arms
around, come back in. All right, take
your desired option and let's go. Extend
[music] and bring it in for one. Extend.

your mat. Come on to hands and knees
position.
All right, my friends. From here, tuck
your toes underneath. We're going to
come into a cat cow bear variation.
Inhale, arch the [music] back. On your
exhale, we're going to come into neutral
and lift the knees off the mat. So, as
you [music] remember, we did this in our
previous class, but today we are
building from it [music] by adding a lot
more bear stances. And then we're going
to add a little bit more shoulder work
to it. It's only going [music] to get
more fun. Good. And center. Hold.
[music] Arch.

Hold, hold, hold, and push back. So, as
if you're coming into a downward dog,
[music] just bend your knees a little
bit and then start to extend, extend,
extend, extend. Beautiful. Hold it here.
Add some movement, as [music] much
movement as you need. Remember, we're
making this as fluid as possible. Really
connecting to that earth element of
water.
Seeing how you can flow through each
movement, flow through each [music]
discomfort, each challenge,
allowing the breath to be that guiding
force, getting [music] you through those
tough moments.
Applying that to your everyday life as
well. Anytime you're starting to feel
life get a little bit too challenging,
overwhelming, taking a pause and just
simply connecting to that breath [music]
of life, that energy that keeps you
moving, keeps you [music] breathing,
keeps you alive. Let's find that
stillness. Holding deep breath [music]
in your downward dog.
Three exhalations.
Letting it go. Really spread [music]
those fingers wide. Roll those elbows
down towards the mat. Inhale.
Exhale.
Inhale again.

Beautiful. Now from here we're going to
walk our feet now to the front of our
mat. So maybe take two to four steps.
[music] Once you come to the front of
your mat, bend your knees, fold from the
hips, and just release into your utenasa
forward fold. Allowing your head to be
nice and loose. We're just doing a
little rock side to side. Lots of nice
[music] gentle movement through the body
and then starting to roll up vertebrae
by vertebrae up to standing.
So we started from the root. As we come
up, rising
all the way up. Reach both arms up to
the sky. Inhale.
Exhale. Draw that energy down towards
your heart center. And just hold for a
moment. Connect to it.

[music] but about intention.

Beautiful. Slowly from here, we're going
to transition back into high plank. And
then come into side plank. So, shift
over to your left hand. Stack your feet
and reach up. If you want to make this
easier, we're going to come down onto
that knee and reach [music] up. This is
a modified version of a side plank. So
you can stay here or of course if you're
really into it and ready for it already,
if you've been practicing for a long
time, of course [music] this is a
variation you can take. We hold, we
breathe, we connect [music] navl to your
spine. Deep breath in. And then we're

Coming back into our boat [music] or
navasana we call in Sanskrit. Drop your
shoulders away from the air. So, we're
just going to find hold that balance.
>> [snorts and sighs]
>> Just find that center. [music]
Then from here, we're going to progress
it one more step. So, we're going to
take the hands behind so you have a
little more support. [music] I'll show
you two different variations because I
understand you might feeling a little
tired and you want to take maybe this
version. So, version one is just to
[music] extend one leg at a time.
Version two, both legs together and come

to lift. Extend your legs and come up.
Now, see if you can just support your
lower back. Now, I'm going to show you a
variation. So, [music] we're coming into
halosa, a full plow position. Now, if
you want to take it about halfway, you
can also keep your knees bent and just
support your low back, your [music]
sacrum as so. This still provides such a
wonderful decompression and stretch for
your back. Otherwise, if it's within
your practice, of course, come into a
full halosa [music] plow position. So,
wherever you are is great. Just find
that breath connection.
Enjoy the release.
Beautiful. To come out, we're just going
to [music] support the low back. Slowly
bring it down. Feet
down onto the mat. And let's take
[music] another spinal twist. Arms open.
Both knees fall to your left as you look
over your right shoulder. Breathe in.
And breathe out.
Same thing other side. Nice stretch.
Look over your other shoulder.
And then back [music] to center.
Nice big hug of your knees.
And then when you're ready, slowly bring
yourself up to seated. So you can just
rock up or you can come on to one side,
whatever is easier for you.
And let's just come back to that center.
Closing off our practice here together.
Taking simply just two breaths.
Just giving and honoring your body here
for a moment before you run off with the
rest of your [music] day. Just take an
inhale.
Exhale. Settle into the energy.
Notice how your body is feeling.
Feel the endorphine release. All the
wonderful
sensations we feel at [music] the end of
a workout, of a practice, of deep inner
physical
and inner connection.
And then to close off, let's take one
final deep breath. Reach both arms up,
lengthening through the spine, gathering
that wonderful, beautiful energy of
[music] light, and then guiding that
energy down into your heart.
And then gently bowing down into your
heart in [music] gratitude, thanking
yourself for your practice, your
dedication, your hard work.
From my heart to yours, thank you
[music] so much for joining me today for
this yoga workout practice. I hope you

============================================================

Heat. Heat.
Hello my wonderful friends. Welcome to
your first day of your best self series.
We are here today in this beautiful yoga
studio at the Marinella Holistic Waldorf
inspired educational center for children
in Barbados. This is actually the school
where Xavier, our son, goes to. So if
you're joining me for this program as
part of your new year initiative, happy
new year. Thank you so much for for
choosing Boho Beautiful and this
particular program because the way we
designed your best self series is
exactly in the way that you need to
really set the path forward to make sure
you have the best year. However, this
program isn't necessarily only to be
done during the start of a year. You can
come back to this particular series any
time throughout the year that you feel
like you need to come back to yourself.
You need to really pave that path
forward in becoming the best version of
yourself because throughout the year we
will always fall off the wagon. And this
is a beautiful opportunity to use and a
program to use as your tool to get back
to yourself and back to the best version
of you. So today, our very first
practice together, we're going to be
really focusing on the foundational
baseline and building up from that. And
I don't say this to kind of say, "Oh,
this is going to be a very easy class."
It's not. It's still going to be a full
body yoga workout. However, you will
notice that as the days go on, every
single day is going to get that much
more difficult. And that is created with
intention and purpose. So, with that,
welcome to day one. You won't need any
props, nothing at all, just yourself and
your mat. Let's get started.
All
right, my friends. So, let's get started
today by first just coming into a seated
position,
feet crossed in front of you. And before
we get started, I really want to take a
moment to honor our body and to really
connect to our body. So, take both hands
onto your heart. Close your eyes
and just welcome a deep breath through
both nostrils,
feeling the texture, the temperature of
the air.
And then as you exhale, let that breath
go.
And just notice how you settle into your
body.
And again, deep breath in through both
nostrils
and exhale all the air out.
Just a few more breaths like this.
Taking this opportunity to
come into the present moment.
Honoring our body. Honoring the
intention
that has brought us here today on this
mat.
Consciously connecting to our body so we
can move through this practice today
with pure awareness and presence.
Let it go.
allowing yourself to detach from any
worries, any to-do lists, any stress,
anything of the world in this moment,
and just simply
come into the presence.
Let it go.
Beautiful. And slowly, when you're
ready, opening your eyes,
just noticing your body, resting your
hands on your knees. Taking a deep
breath in, reaching both of your arms up
to the sky. Nice big stretch. And then
exhale, taking a big side reach.
Breathing into the side body
and then coming back to center.
Switching to the other side
and coming back to center.
And simply from here, just reaching one
more time up and then guiding your body
forward, allowing your forehead to come
all the way down.
Again, we're just starting with gentle
movement, gentle stretches before we
start to really activate a little bit
more power, more heat in the body.
Finding your breath, deepening your
breath, just like we started the
practice with.
anchoring in this breath and allowing it
to be your guiding force through this
whole practice today.
Wonderful. Slowly from here, come on up.
Bring your hands over to your heart
center and then go ahead and bring your
feet to the front of your mat.
Good. We're going to start with a seated
cat cow and then move a little bit more
into core activation. So, first just
placing your hands under your knees.
Inhale, arch and look up. And then
exhale, round and bring your chin
towards your chest. So really feeling
that stretch in your upper back. Inhale,
look up.
Exhale, let it go.
Inhale, look up.
Exhale, let it go.
One more time. Inhale, look up.
Now exhale, start to release. Now I'm
going to show you two different versions
that you can do this movement. So first
take it one vertebrae at a time.
Now one variation is to use your arms,
reach them over your head and then use
the momentum and roll yourself up using
the strength of your core. A little bit
easier version again you can adapt to
what you need is holding underneath your
knees the whole time. So, as you come
down, you breathe in. Exhale, you roll
up, lift your shoulder blades off the
mat, and use your legs to help you come
up. All right. So, I'm going to again
give you that opportunity to find that
baseline for yourself. I'm going to do
the version two, but you feel free to
take that other version. So, slowly
reaching and activating the core. The
most important thing is your feet stay
completely grounded and connected on
your mat the entire time. You want to
start to use the core to do all the work
here. Rolling up, reaching forward.
Exhale. Come back down. Nice and slow.
Nice and slow.
The idea of conscious workout is not
about speed. It's about alignment and
doing the work properly. So even if you
have to slow down the movement, maybe do
half the reps, but it's not about just
getting it done. It's about doing it
right.
And again, reach forward.
Good. Now, come on down. We're going to
take it a little slower and really start
to activate the core. So, maybe come
down halfway. Hold it here. Pull the
navl right into your spine. Sometimes
you'll even feel your core starting to
shake and that's totally normal. And
then go a little deeper. Feel those
shakes coming in. A little more.
And then come on down. Beautiful. Reach
your arms over your head. Hug your knees
into your chest. Inhale. Exhale. Extend
your right leg all the way down. Pull
your left knee into your chest. Give it
a nice big stretch. Feel that stretch
through this through the soaz here. Flex
your left foot. Bring it up. Now take
your piece fingers, grab your big left
toe, and open it to the side.
Good. Just think about pulling that knee
towards the ground. Shoulders are
resting on the floor.
Great. From here, extending your left
leg, reach behind the knee if you need
to. Maybe even keep it bent if you have
to. That's totally fine. So, the goal is
to get to that extension, but you don't
have to get there today. So, just
feeling that nice stretch.
And then bringing your knee into your
chest,
arms down, lift your right leg off the
mat and hold. If you want to make this a
little bit more intense, you can look
forward. Otherwise, keep your head down.
Let's hold and breathe. Maybe reach the
arms forward for that extra level, but
you don't have to. You can keep it at
level one. From here, we switch. 1 2
3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Bring your right knee
in. Left leg extends. Hold for a moment.
Keep pulling that knee into the chest.
So you feel a beautiful stretch here.
Breathe it in.
Flex your foot. Extend a little bit.
Take your piece fingers. Grab your big
right toe. Open to the side. Left arm
reaches down. And I want you to feel the
stretch here in the hip. And breathe.
Single-legged happy baby pose. Really
getting into the hips.
Awakening
your joints, your muscles.
Extending now this leg up. Again, feel
free to hold the back of your knee. Flex
your foot. Maybe your knee extends
halfway. Really, again, this is your
practice. You do you. Extend it to your
potential.
And then we bend the knee. Let's do one
more set of our single-legged switches.
Again, you can just keep your body down,
lift your left leg up, or reach forward
for a little bit more intensity. And we
switch for one 2 3 4. Breathe. Five.
Exhale. 6 7 8 9 10. Bring both legs up.
Flex your feet open. Take a happy baby.
So, you're grabbing big toes or the
outsides of your feet. You pull the
knees down. Maybe do a little rock. Is a
really nice hip opening position. Just
be very careful that you're not reaching
with your shoulders. You want to keep
the shoulders down.
Find your breath.
Great. From here, extend.
Bring your knees in. Plant your feet
down. We're going to start to slowly
make our way up. We're kind of going
from grounded position and rising
upwards. So, first we're going to come
into that bridge variation, lifting and
squeezing your glutes. So, first really
activating and finding that baseline of
this position. So lift and squeeze your
glutes and then slowly start to lower
down one vertebrae at a time. So again,
it's all about that conscious movement,
feeling every muscle in your body
activating, feeling that connection of
each vertebrae of your spine on the mat
as you come down nice and slow. And then
lift it back up.
When we're starting to create a
foundation to build upon, it's really
important to find that perfect
alignment. Because once you're in
alignment, then you can start to
activate and strengthen the body and the
muscles. But if the alignment is
incorrect, you only bring yourself
closer to injury
and completely dissoc.
So really focus on the alignment first.
So squeeze and lift. Let's hold it here.
Keep your arms down or bring them up if
you want to make this a little bit more
challenging. Shift your weight to your
right foot. Bring your left leg up.
Bring it back down. And we switch for
two. Good. Again, just showing a
different version is to keep your arms
down, which gives you a little bit more
support. So, we just activating the
lower body, walking out on one spot.

Bring your both knees into your chest.
Hug your knees. Deep breath in.
Exhale out.
Good. From here, hold on to the knees.
Rolling like a ball. You're going to
rock up and then find your center. So,
the goal here is to not let your toes or
your feet touch the mat. So, you want to
keep your body rounded and then find
your balance here. Very good. Rock and
up.
Rock up and hold. Last time
holding here. So you can modify this by
placing the hands onto the mat. Hold. If
you want to, of course, go further

Exhale. Maybe bring your feet together
or keep them slightly apart if that
feels more natural to you. Bend your
knees if you need to to first start to
hinge from your hips and then come all
the way down into forward fold. Really
important, I'll say this once, that you
don't fold from your back like so. This
is going to cause injury. You want to
stay straight and just fold from the
hips forward.
Good. And just breathe here.
Inhale.
Exhale
again. Deep breath in.

Find your breath. Inhale.
Exhale. Bring it up. Arms up. Crossing

Can you hold this a little longer for me
now? So, you just want to get those
knees hovered, pressing into the mat.
Shoulders are activated. Breathe. Three.
Two. Now, we're going to push your
weight all the way back. Bend your
knees, extend through the upper body,
and start to slowly extend your left leg
and then your right leg into your
downward dog variation. So, first we're
welcoming movement just to get your body
warmed up, feeling really loose and
nice, and then we're going to come into
stillness through our downward-f facing
dog.
Good. So, once you feel a little bit
more warm, then start to see if you can
extend those knees and open up again.
And if you need to slightly bend your
knees for keeping the alignment
properly, then that's fine. Find your
breath.
Let's take three deep breaths. Inhale
into your nose.

Inhale into your nose.

One more time. Inhale into your nose.
Now exhale. So, we're going to round

to you as well.
So, I want you to really think of
activation. So, navl to spine. You
activate the core center, your
powerhouse. For an added resistance, of
course, reach your opposite arm. We're
just going to hold and breathe. So, it's
about finding and rooting into that
strength. It's not about adding extra
movement. It's about pure connection and
holding stillness.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Bring your left knee into your chest.
Exhale. Extend for one. Bring it in.
Exhale for two. Bring it in. Exhale for
three. Bring it in. Exhale for four.

your foot. Tuck your back toes. Inhale.
Exhale. Push back and release. Feel this
wonderful stretch through the inner
growing muscle.
Find your inhale.

say find your center, I mean connect to

Other arm reaches forward. You square
your shoulders and you hold here.

Go a little deeper. Noticing the heat
building in your body, which allows you
to go a little further through the
downward dog, through this aa. One more
inhale.
Exhale.
Left leg reaches up. Your choice. You
can either just lift it up slightly,
keep the hips square, or open into a
more three-legged dog variation where
the hips slightly open. From here, bend
your left knee. Come forward into a
plank. Bring that knee to chest and
bring it back up for one. Bring that
knee to chest
and back up. One more time. Bring the
knee to chest and hold. Drop the knee
down. Lift your right leg. So now again,
just square out the hips. Check with
your alignment. Navl to spine. And this
is where we find that stillness and
hold. Again, I remind you you can
advance this a little more by placing
your opposite arm forward or even
placing it onto your elbow or keep it on
the mat.
This is where we connect to the breath.
Notice how your body responds. It's very
natural to start to feel a little bit of
shaking in the muscles. The muscles are
starting to get activated. They're
waking up. They're also starting to get
fatigued. So, all of those things are
happening.
Okay, one more deep breath in.
On your exhale, let's crunch it in for

Flex your foot. Bring it all the way
around and plant your foot down onto the
mat. Good. From here, tuck your back
toes and just lean back. Noticing this
wonderful stretch here through the side.
Find your breath. This is a perfect
opportunity if you want to close your
eyes. Just breathe into the movement.
Breathe into the asa.
Noticing where the sensation arises
and then come back up. And let's go a
little bit deeper. Taking your right
arm, reach it up and thread that arm
through.
Then from here, your elbow can either
just stay up or you can reach the other
arm forward. If you're reaching it
forward, you want to try and square the
shoulders out. So you're going to really
feel this nice deep stretch through the
upper body here.
Great job.
Bending your elbow.
Come back around.
Bring the arm through. Lift the leg. And
you're going to bring it all the way
back. Squeeze. Inhale. Bend your knee.

your arms through. Tuck your toes. See
if you can lift up. Come into a full
crescent lunge. A little bit more
activation the lower body. Noticing all
the muscles waking up.
And then bring the knee down. If you
want to make it a little easier, hand
down. Nice little twist. Reach your arm

little more challenging, lift your back
knee off the mat. Otherwise, stay
grounded here.

very moment.

chest. the blood rushing through your
body,

opportunity to connect deeper to your
own heart, breath, and inner state of
being. So, if you're ready to get
started, grab your mat and let's begin.

where my leg extends. It's aligned with
the rest of my body. So, it's a side

hip. Let's pump the leg. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 more. 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. Now hold
it here. I'm just going to turn around
so I can face the front of the camera.
You stay exactly where you are and let's
take that bicycle pedal with the legs.
So, bend the knee, pull it in, and just
that slight bit of a kick back. Good.
Bring it in. And as you extend it back,
just a little inch back. So, you feel
that slight engagement in the back of
the glute. Bring it in and back. Bring
it in. Don't lose the height of the leg.
I know it's difficult. Just stay with
me. Stay with the breath. Do your best.
Push and back. If you need to take a
break, that's totally fine. Pause the
video. Do what you got to do. Let's hold
it here now. Extend. Just breathe. And
then let's release and just extend the
leg back into that bird dog variation.
And then step your left foot to the
front of your mat. Low lunge.
Good. Just find your center, your
balance. Find your breath.
Front knee on top of your ankle. Feel
that stretch in the hip flexor. And then
clasp the hands behind your back. Extend
through the elbows and open through that
heart center.
Open up. Open up through the chest. Tuck
your back toes. Lift the back knee.
Inhale. Exhale. Chest towards the front
knee for one. Inhale, open. And then
exhale, bring the chest down for two.
Inhale, open.
Exhale, 3.
Inhale, open.
Exhale, four.
Inhale, open.
Hold it here.
We'll open up a little further, a little
deeper. And then place both hands down
to the floor. Extending through the
front knee into pyramid pose. Working
with the breath first. Inhale.
Exhale. Push back. Getting right into
that left hamstring. Flexing the front
foot for a deeper sensation.
Inhale.
Exhale.
Inhale.
And exhale.
Inhale forward.
Exhale. Let's hold it here. Now square
those hips out. Keep your back heel
lifted. Relax over top of that front
leg. Breathe it out.
Nice long exhalation.
Allowing yourself to relax into this
posture.
Deeply inhale
and slowly exhale.
Returning back into that lunge. Keep the
palms of your hands grounded and then
step back into downward-facing dog.
Beautiful.
Deep breath in.
Exhale out. Just enjoy this posture for
a moment.
One more breath in and then exhale.
Round through into plank and give me a
flow. Chaturanga,
upward-facing dog.
And then exhale, push into the hands.
Downward-facing dog.
Awesome.
Inhale
and exhale. From here, go ahead and just
hop to the front of your mat. Bend your
knees. We're going to land over to our
seated position. Bring the soles of your
feet together. Come into butterfly pose.
Hold on to the ankles. Inhale.
Exhale down. Working with the movement
and breath combining together.
Good. Inhale. Open.
And exhale. Let's come down. And let's
just hold it here.
Noticing the release of your hips.
Forehead down. Deep breath in.
[Music]
Exhale out.
Deep breath in again.
Exhale out.
[Music]
Now we're going to move on to our next
Pilates exercise called your seal rolls.
So you're going to come on up, take your
hands and bring them through and grab
onto the ankles. Lift your feet off the
mat. You're going to do a little tap
with your toes. One, two. Then roll like
a ball. Roll it back. Roll it back up.
Hold your center and do a tap tap. Roll
and up. Tap tap. Very good. So again,
we're engaging the core here to find
that balance as you come up with control
to not let your feet just touch the
ground as you roll up. And that's okay
if they do, as you saw with me here.
Let's do it again. Roll it back and
hold. Tap tap. Roll it back. Hold. Tap
tap. Roll it back. Hold. Tap tap. And
then roll your spine all the way down.
Keep your legs exactly as they are. Take
your arms now over and around to the
side. And you're just going to reach to
one corner of your mat and then the
other. Reach. Reach. Reach. Reach. So
keep your toes touching. Knees and heels
are apart. Diamond shape with your legs.
Keep reaching. Reach. Reach. Use those
obliques to do the work. Reach. Reach.
Shoulders off the mat. Keep it going.
Touch the front corners of your mat with
your hands. One, two. One, two. You got
it. One, two. One, two. Keep the
position of your legs. Don't lose the
form.
Keep reaching.
Moving on to our frogger exercise. Touch
your heels together. Flex your feet.
Head and shoulders down. From here on
your exhale, press away with your feet
and legs and bring it in. Push and in.
Heels continue to touch. Toes are now
facing apart. Press away and in. If you
want a little more challenging, lift
your shoulder blades and arms forward.
Push and in. If you want to keep it a
little easier, keep your head and arms
on the floor. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale.
Last one. Exhale. Point your toes. Bring
them up. Drop your head. Drop the arms.
Corkcrew. All you're going to do is just
do a big circle with the legs and around
for one. Keep your arms close to your
body. Even place your hands slightly
underneath your glutes just to support
yourself a little further.
The bigger the circle, the harder the
exercise. So adjust it to what you need.
Good. Keep the rest of your body
relaxed. Just reverse the circle to the
left or right depending on the direction
you started with
and around. Good. Keep it going.
Circle around and
circle around. One more time. And then
land at the center. Open your toes.
Bring your heels together. We're going
to take small crisscrosses. Keep your
head down. Or for extra added intensity,
hands come behind your head. And now
just cross it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
Little crisscross. Crissross. Use your
inner thighs to do the work. Of course,
engaging the core the entire time.
Crisscross. Crisscross. Crissross.
Good. Just keep it going as fast as you
can without losing momentum and form.
And then drop it down.
Great job. Grab your left leg. Drop your
right leg down. Hold the stretch. Bring
it back to center.
Other side.
Bring it back to center. Then straight
single leg switches. Drop your right
leg. Bring your left leg. Pulse. One 2 3
4. Open those legs. 1 2 exhale 3 4
inhale 1 2 exhale 3 4 little pulse 1 2
switch pulse pulse switch pulse pulse
switch pulse pulse so one hand reaches
for the ankle the other holds onto the
back of your knee each time you grab
onto that top leg
one 2 and 3 4 1 Two. Breathe it out.
Breathe it in. Breathe it out. And back
to center. Drop your head down. From
here, flex your feet. And then take our
plow position by bringing your feet all
the way back. Support your lower back
with your hands. Bend your elbows. If
you like, extend your elbows and
interlace your fingers into our full
halosa or plow.
Let's hold this inversion.
Breathe deeply. Finding that position on
your shoulders because from here we're
going to extend further.
[Music]
Inhale.
Exhale.
Inhale again.
[Music]
Exhale.
Hands back onto the hips. And then lift
your legs up into a full shoulder stand.
Supporting your hips,
reaching with your toes up to the sky.
Feel this lengthening sensation.
Keep reaching. Keep reaching.
And this is what's going to get us ready
to do our next Pilates exercise, which
is your jack knife. There's going to be
a couple different ways for us to do
this. So, I'll walk you through it. Go
ahead and just take one more deep breath
in in your shoulder stand. And then
exhale. Bring those feet back. Back into
that plow halosa. Release your hands so
they're along the sides of your mat.
And then slowly release your body. Lower
the legs.
Bring the legs up. And either you're
just going to come up to about halfway.
Second version is to do a little lift
with your hips and your knees bent. And
the third version, most advanced, is to
come into a full shoulder stand, jack
knife. All right. So, let's take
whatever version you like. So, either
version one, just the legs, or full jack
knife. I'm going to do the full version,
but you do you.
And two. Good. So, either just a
straight leg lift, but lift your bum and
hips off the mat just slightly. So you
can keep your knees bent when they reach
that center point position and forward
after that.
Good. Bring it down. Exhale. Bring the
hips up. Do your best to try and get
those toes up to the sky. But of course,
don't sacrifice the form for it.
Listen to your own body. As your legs
drop, make sure you don't arch your
lower back. So support your back with
your hands under your glutes. And most
importantly, don't go too low with the
legs if you feel as if your core
completely gives out and your back takes
over. So maybe go about halfway.
Once you're done, final movement, we're
just going to lower the legs all the way
down with control
and then bend your knees and bring your
knees into your chest. One more time.
Take a big exhale out. A gentle rock
side to side. Massage that lower back.
And then let's go a little bit deeper
into our hips at this time
by simply extending your legs. Flex your
feet. Hold on to the ankles. And then
open into happy baby. Maybe reach the
outsides of your feet.
Feel free to add a gentle rock left and
right if that feels really nice in your
hips. You can also find stillness and
just hold it there.
whatever feels good.
And then if you like to go deeper, go
ahead and extend your legs and see if
you can open them out into this reverse
dragonfly
using the pressure of your hands on your
knees and hold it there. Of course, if
this is way too intense for you today,
you can always come back into your happy
baby.
So listen to your body and then when
you're ready to come out, bend your
knees, bring the soles of your feet
together, come into reclined butterfly
or sabbatanasana,
palms open, arms rested by your side.
Let's just close off our wonderful
practice today with a couple of deep
breaths and a nice quick relaxation to
close off this practice.
Allow your body to let go and release
into the mat.
Allow your knees to open. Feeling that
gentle stretch through the groin,
through the inner thighs.
Just follow your breath. Exhaling.
Letting go a little deeper each time.
You can stay here longer if you like or
bring your knees together. Roll over to
one side and meet me in a seated
position anywhere along your mat.
Feet crossed in front of you. Knees
open.
Roll your shoulders back a few times.
Just find that center. And let's take a
big breath together. Reaching both arms
up to the sky. Then exhale. Bring your
hands down to your heart. Bowing down to
your heart in gratitude for your amazing
practice today. Thank you for joining me
in beautiful Barbados. We'll see you
soon. Namaste.

I'm being accountable to show up here
every single morning with you guys and
to practice so really excited for this
now with that let's get started with our
practice today so like I mentioned
earlier our practice is going to be all
about just letting go of the heaviness
letting go of anything you're still
holding on in your mind in your body
from 2024 this is going to be our very
last class together of the year so you
know think about it what is it that
you're ready to let go of create space
for so then when we enter 2025 we are
clear and ready to welcome all the
goodness in so let's begin let's start
by coming into a nice seated
position we're going to cross our feet
in front
we're going to ground ourselves onto our
mat just feel both of your sip bones
right on your mat drop the shoulders
down away from the
ears close your
eyes let's take a deep breath in and
just feel that
expansion in your lungs in your belly
coming
out and then exhale I want you let go of
everything let go of your day let go
what you have to do today
and just bring yourself into this
present
moment bring yourself on your
mat
exhale good another inhale i' like you
to just reach both of your arms up to
the sky interlace your fingers and point
your index fingers up and just feel this
nice lengthening sensation now if you're
joining me here this morning and if it's
morning for you right now this is such a
nice stretch and position to just start
your day with because you're expanding
everything good pulling it up releasing
any tension in the spine and the
shoulders and then exhale release over
to one side now I welcome you guys to
keep your eyes closed here if you can
because to start our practice really
connected internally is a really
beautiful way to just connect to your
intention
connect to your why connect to what
brought you here on your mat this
morning what brought you to take this
time out of your day and to press that
play button and get on your mat like
what is it for
you think about it as you go a little
bit deeper into your
exhale good and then come back to Center
and switch to the other side same thing
just keep your eyes
closed I encourage you to practice the
uai breathing today through our flow as
I mentioned um it's a feel-good flow
which means we're going to be doing a
lot of movement a lot of movement
connected to your breath so practice the
uay breathing which will help bring a
little bit more peace and calm the
nervous system for
you just a reminder of what an UI breath
this is when you inhale through your
nose and when you exhale you just
slightly constrict the back of your
throat and make almost like an ocean
sound or some people even say Darth
Vader sound whatever works for you but
think about that slight constriction you
hear your own exhale which is a reminder
to go a little bit deeper to connect a
little bit
further there's no music here in this
practice today so if you do like to
practice with music of course you're
more than welcome to put something on
however I encourage you to practice to
the sound of your own breath today
that's a really powerful way to stay
present move to the sound of your
breath come back to
Center placing your hands on your knees
on your inhale let's just open our heart
open our chest lift and look up with
your head when you exhale you're going
to tuck that chin to the chest you round
the spine and just release everything
forward moving with the breath inhale as
you
open
exhale and
release inhale as you
open exhale and
release inhale as you
open and exhale
release beautiful good come back to
neutral one more breath in reach both
arms
up as you exhale bring the hands and
unal mudra into your heart and you may
open your eyes at this time if you wish
and then hands come down bring your
knees up and let's just meet over to the
middle of our mat hands and knees
position going a little deeper into the
spine getting some movement fluidity

Arch the back look up exhale round the
spine and release

movement Circle the body into the left
you can make this movement as big or
small as it feels for
you just adding as much movement into
the shoulders even maybe the neck and
the
head good and then other
side and so in these reflective moments
when we're just moving maybe closing our
eyes I want you to think about this year
to think about 2024 and all of the
wonderful blessings gifts and challenges
and lessons that you are coming out with
just think about all of
that
good and then with each exhale I want
you to
intentionally make a decision today in
this practice together that we're going
to Exhale and release all of those
things that we no longer need to carry
any of that heaviness regrets fears
whatever it is doubts I want you to just
exhale it out today all right tuck your
toes inhale exhale push back towards
your heels and extend through the
shoulders drop the shoulders away from
the airs a downward dog but I want you
to stay with your knees bent for a
moment staying with your uay breath with
each
exhalation I want you to welcome this
thought and intention that I just
mentioned what is it that you're ready
to leave behind what is it is it that
you're ready to let go of burn in the
fire deep breath in now as you exhale
I'd like you to just pivot your knees
towards the left tent your left
fingertips and almost like you're trying
to peek through towards your left armpit
and I want you to start to feel this
beautiful release through the left side
of your
body maybe you want to let go of the
left fingers and you can even open a
little bit more or keep them tented on

body go ahead and do

intention come back to a little moment
of process processing the
year so often we just move from one
month to the next from one day to the
next from one year to the next without
giving ourselves the opportunity to just
pause and reflect and process everything
that
happened everything beautiful and not so
beautiful right it's part of life it's
the cycle of life and in order to move
forward we have to make peace with
everything that came
so use this opportunity right now not
just here on the map in the last few
days that we have left of 2024 use this
opportunity to just
reflect process it
all take all the good from it all the
lessons and leave all the baggage and
all the
heaviness all the leftovers
behind one more deep breath
in exhale
come back good keep your hands on the
mat lift your back knee hold and then I
like you to step back into high plank
position take that flow
chaturanga upward facing
dog exhale downward facing
dog good take another three deep breaths
here allow yourself to go a little bit
deeper
inhale exhale
good
inhale
exhale great inhale slowly from here go
ahead and reach your right leg up to the
sky hold for a moment bend your knee and
then bring it through bring that knee
right in between your arms hold for
three 2 one step your right foot between
your two hands stay here keep your left
hand grounded and just reach your right
arm up to the sky into a nice
twist and keep your gaze down or look up
towards those
fingertips keep bringing your fingertips
up but bring your gaze down and then
lead with that top arm as you come back
up into that high lunge but this time
see if you can reach towards the back
knee with your right hand deep breath in
now exhale we're going to cartwheel
meaning you're going to lead with that
left hand down Pull and turn and pivot
the right toe so they're facing the
middle uh the wide part of your mat and
then bend your knees and come into a
skandasana so hands can come down or
they can come at your heart and then you
pivot and open your toes so holding the
skandasana
breathe deep breath in so really feel
that nice opening in the
hip good good if you like to go a little
deeper what you can do here is now grab
your right ankle with your left hand and
either just reach forward or bring your
right arm up so feeling a little bit
more of an opening through the hip you
can even now take the hand behind your
head and start to go a little deeper
again couple different variations for
you guys please play with it see what
feels right for you maybe all of this
feels way too much today and you're just
going to hold or even hold up here okay
so wherever you are just be there for
another breath in and then exhale let's
bring both of our hands down onto the
mat drop so then you're on your left sip
bone then you're going to let that right
knee drop so you're facing the back of
your mat allow both of your sit bones to
come grounded left foot is flexed inhale
reach exhale come into your forward fold
see if you can grab your ankle or the
back of your knee let's work with the
breath inhale on on your exhalation with
your uay breath let
yourself
relax with your relaxation you allow
your body to come closer towards the leg
inhale
exhale

exhale slowly from here come on up with
both arms hands at your heart open up
that that knee lift up hands now come to
the front of your mat pivot pivot pivot
until you come back into that high lunge
coming back into that twist reaching
your right arm deep breath
in good now from here I'm going to give
you two different transitions transition
one a little easier is just to bring
your hand down bring your leg up and
then fall back into a wild thing
transition two is to go straight from
here by shifting your weight bringing
your leg up and then meeting me right in
our wild thing or reversed dog Lift Up
Lift Up open them through the
hips and then come back to Center coming
back up with your right knee right knee
to your right thumb coming into your
pigeon drop it down inhale tent your
fingertips open up through the body
exhale Bend your elbows and just drop
your forehead to the mat a few times
like this inhale
open
exhale inhale

exhale last time inhale
open and now exhale let's come down into
your pigeon I'd like you to close your
eyes and let's hold here for a
moment coming back to Our intention
what is it that you wish
to take with you into 2025 what
lessons what gifts what
opportunities what are you ready ready
to
face what are you ready to welcome is it
new habits
is it a
better morning
routine is it more meditation in your
life what what is it just ask yourself
and answer to your own
self just breathe through
it any Sensations that you feel
physically in your body I want you to
breathe through them well welome a
little more oxygen into the body deepen
your
breath lengthen your exhale so you feel
that physical release that relaxation
that you welcome with your
breath allowing this sensation to
release any tension you may feel in your
glutes in your back right
now let's welcome one more breath in
and then exhale tent your fingers back
up push into the fingers as you lift up
ground your hands tuck your toes I'd
like you to step right into
downward-facing dog and
release come through into plank
chaturanga upward-facing
dog exhale downward-facing
dog now inhale reach your left leg up to
the Sky hold for a moment bend your knee
and now bring that left knee towards
your chest and just hold for three 2 one
step your left foot between your two
hands hands grounded I'd like you to
reach your left arm now up to the
sky coming into a nice
twist you can follow it with your eyes
or you can keep your gaze down whatever
feels better for you
and now let's follow that left arm as it
comes all the way back reaching your
right arm up
hold keep reaching elongating finding
that strength and power in your legs and
then release your left arm you're going
to bring your right arm back as you
pivot pivot your front toes and then
you're going to bend your knees opening
your right toes up into our skandasana
so as you can see if first I'm hovered
above the mat so you can do that of
course you can even be up here if that
feels better I understand sometimes your
hips can feel really tight inner thighs
your growing muscle can feel really
tight so just
adjust you can balance here if you want
to go deeper you can even drop down and
reach forward with your hands
or grab your use your right hand grab
your left ankle drop down and then you
can reach up or bend your elbow and
allow yourself to fall down so again
play with it guys I know there's many
different variations we can take with
this position and it all depends on how
far you want to take it
today I Want You to Breathe
inhale exhale come to center now if
you're still hovered I'd like you to now
come down with your hips hands at your
heart now we're going to Pivot and face
the back of your mat as you drop this
left knee make sure both SI bones are
grounded inhale
and then exhale come down into your
forward fold

so really think about that alignment
keep pulling your right hip back push
your left hip forward so you're keeping

slight micro adjustment can make the
entire world of a difference in the
sensations that you
feel so be very aware very
mindful how everything feels inside your
body come back up
hands to your heart we open back up see
if you can lift right up into skandasana
hands to the front of your mat pivot

inhale exhale now come down onto your
elbows maybe come all the way
down Square your hips
Out close your
eyes and just take that long exhale
out bringing yourself back to all those
questions you've been asking yourself
already now asking
yourself what are you ready to leave
behind imagine as if we're just turning
a page of a
book we're turning a new page a new year
but what what is it that you want to
leave in the 2024 page what is it that
you don't need to continue to take with
you to hold on to
you don't need to carry anymore what
what
weight regrets fears guilt whatever you
feel maybe this is a good moment for you
to come to peace with
it and with your exhalation consciously
just make a choice right
now to no longer
be held by
it you no longer need to carry it
you don't need to live with it anymore
you can leave it
behind and with your exhale just
visualize
yourself leaving it behind or letting it
evaporate creating space within yourself
within your heart within your
mind for all the new wonderful
opportunities experiences and feelings
that you're ready to welcome in the new
year
you deserve
to be happy deserve to be and live in
peace remember
that so whatever that may be standing in
your way of living this way maybe it's
time to
consider to leave it
behind life is too short to carry it
forward let's welcome one more deep
breath in

you like or slowly roll up into a seated
position and we're just going to finish
our practice here today in a hero pose

to place your hands onto your heart I'm
going to Face Forward here so I can
really feel like I'm here with you but
i' like you to close your
eyes and I want you to feel your heart
feel the beating of your own
heart feel the
rhythm just bring awareness to this one
motion that happens nonstop that is the
reason why you're
alive the center of everything
that keeps you moving and
breathing this Prana energy that is your
life force just connect with
that let it remind
you of your own power of your own
strength
let it remind you that you are always in
control that we may not be able to
control what life brings us the
circumstances of our life but what we
always have control over is how we
choose to react to those
circumstances how we choose to show up
for
ourselves for our family for our loved
ones for our community
for the
world that you have control
over so let that reminder fill you up
with all the strength and love that you
need let it give you strength to leave
behind all that no longer serves
you leave behind all that
heaviness and let it give you strength
and power
to walk forward into 2025 into the new
year with the
courage love and light that you
are when you're ready just go ahead and
release your hands and let's take one
final deep breath together reaching both
arms
up fill your lungs with all the oxygen

your
heart just taking this opportunity to
bow down to your own heart to your own

[Music]
hello
everybody
Welcome to day one of our daily dose
initiative I am so excited to be
starting here today very first first day
of the year very first yoga practice
here together of 2025 so thank you so
much for joining me I'm very very
excited to get started today now just a
quick little thing I wanted to mention
we are sharing this practice on YouTube
right now so if you are watching this
class this is going to be part of our
31-day daily dose initiative that is
going on right now and it is no better
time than to start a beautiful practice
for self that includes of yoga and um
mindfulness and Consciousness so if you
haven't yet and if you're again if
you're just seeing this for the first
time on YouTube please feel free to
check out the link below in the
description you can join us at any time
but with that my friends here I am just
delighted to be really opening the space
together with you today and as you might
have seen um the the title of this class
there is a little Sanskrit word at the
end that we have included which is going
To Be Our intention and so this
intention in this word is shti which is
a Sanskrit word that translates to
Purity it it translates to different
type of cleansing and purifications that
we do so that we can reach a state of
clarity Purity and balance in our mind
and body and so this is this is the most
perfect intention to have as our very
first class of 2025 because there's a
lot of releasing and detoxification that
we must first create and do in our own
bodies and our own minds so that we can
create that space for new energy for new
mindset for everything new which comes
with 2025 to enter so let's keep this
intention in our hearts throughout the
whole practice today I will remind you
of it throughout the class as well this
is going to be a detox flow so we're
going to be doing lots of twists and
it'll be nice it'll feel good remember
remember this is your practice so you
can modify anything you need you can
take any postures and take a pause you
can advance them if you need to or you
can take them a little bit easier so
just listen to your own body so with
that let's
begin let's get started today by just
coming to a seated position I'd like you
to congrat round it with your si bones
cross your feet in
front just take a moment to really come
into your body right so just close your
eyes maybe take a big breath out roll
your shoulders
down I'd like you to place your hands at
your heart first I always love to start
a beautiful initiative together by
connecting with our own heart with our
own heartbeat with our own pronic energy
with our own selves
inside so close your eyes and just begin
to listen to the beat of your own
heart the rhythm of
it inhaling through both nostrils and
then as you
exhale let's just welcome this
intention
this idea of purification cleansing
shti what is
it that you are ready to leave
behind what is it that you wish to
Exhale through the practice today that
perhaps you've been carrying through the
past year but now you are ready to put
it to bed and not take it with you on
this first day of this brand new chapter
so it could be many things so just take
a
moment and inquire within your own
heart
good then inquire what is it that you're
ready to welcome into your heart through
the space that we will be creating today
in our bodies and our minds what are we
going to be calling in through that
energy through that process of
purification let's take one more deep
breath
in I'd like you to feel that expansion
in your
lungs in your
belly then
exhale is release your hands perhaps
open your eyes let's take a big stretch
both arms are going to reach up to the
sky lengthening through the body
drop the shoulders down and just reach
and lengthen through the arms while
feeling this nice decompression in the
spine good and then as you exhale I'd
like you to go ahead and just take a
gentle twist and take one hand to the
opposite knee the other arm behind and
just look over your
shoulder just a nice way to start to
awaken a little bit more the spine the
back there
inhale come back to
Center exhale switch to the other side
look over your
shoulder really important that you focus
on pulling up through the crown of your
head so don't hunch around in the spine
everything should be lengthened and
straight come back to Center inhale
reach both arms up again and then as you
exhale go ahead and just bring your arms
forward and maybe walk them to the
front and I want you to just allow the
chest to relax maybe come all the way
down if you like to take a Little Rock
you're more than welcome to do that as
well I always welcome movement in
practices because it's important to just
get into our bodies right and sometimes
just finding Stillness right away may
not feel so good so you're more than
welcome to move at any point if you want
to do big rocking just feel your body
how's your back feeling how are your
shoulders feeling how is your mind
feeling right is your mind already being
pulled away to many directions or are
you able to stay focused with your
breath I encourage you to practice the
uai breathing
today only because it's such a wonderful
pranayama to work through our practice
that allows you to keep the nerve
nervous system calm allows you to stay
focused on your breath on the moment on
the
presence of yourself on the mat let's
slowly come on
up good take your arms behind you just
bring your knees up and let's take a
quick little windshield wipe with the
knees just a few times again getting a
little bit deeper into the hips here
warming them
up good
it's our very first practice today
together so we're going to really take
our time and get into all the joints and
all the parts of the body so you feel
really connected and open through every
part of your body today all right now
from here let's just bring both feet to
the front of your mat I like you place
your hands behind your knees let's just
start with the seated cat Cow getting a
little deeper into the spine inhale I'd
like you to drop the shoulders open your
heart and then as you exhale tuck your
chin into the chest extend through the
elbows but keep holding onto the knees
and just round with your chin to chest
inhale
open exhale
release now remember that ocean sound
that we're creating through the
constriction of our throat in this UI
[Music]
breath let it remind you of how much you
are in control here you are in control
of your breath you are in control of
your body you are in control of your
mind so bring it into this moment right
now don't let anything take you away
from this experience we've got 60
minutes here together you can always
come back after the hour to it right so
come back all the way now to your back
hug your knees into the
chest maybe take a Little Rock side to
side if that feels
good and then holding on to your left
knee I'd like you to extend your right
leg and flex your right foot let's just
hold this position noticing all the
feelings through the back of your leg
the hamstring the calf muscle deep
breath in keeping that flexion in the
foot so you're engaging through the calf
muscle and slowly take your time start
to engage a little bit in the core by
pulling the navl to the spine and
lowering the leg for
four for
three for two can you hold and hover
that leg hold
it and then relax keep your left knee at
your chest and just pull a little closer
maybe roll out that left ankle getting
into the ankle joints
here and then rock your left knee
slightly left and right to get into the
hip joint
and then flexing your left foot slightly
breach as if you're pointing the heel up
to the sky but then take your piece
fingers or grab the outside of your left
foot and then pull it open to a
single-legged happy baby so we're just
focusing on that left hip right now so
allow the hip to open your right arm the
other arm just opens to the side you can
also place your hand on your hip if that
feels better what's important is that we
don't let your right hip just come off
the floor so you want to stay grounded
shoulders are grounded and breathe with
your exhale begin to pull this left knee
down
inhale
exhale great and then from here go ahead
and extend now grab the back of your
left knee and just push push push extend
your left leg hold it here pull your
right knee into your chest and switch
hands and now grab your right knee
you're continuing to hold keeping that
left foot flexed feeling all the
sensations now through the other
side and just breathing
here and then on your exhale pull your
Naval into the spine start to lower the
leg for four counts four
3
2 one hover and hold make sure you're
not lifting with your shoulders
everything is grounded and relaxed
you're just engaging a little bit
through the core Center here and then
relaxing your left leg pulling your
right knee a little bit closer towards
your chest maybe roll out that right
ankle now good lots of little
circles this is the start of your day
for you it is for me here it's normal to
feel little extra cracks and adjustments
in our
body but it could also be the same if
you've had a day of um sagittary day
maybe you've been lying around relaxing
whatever you've been doing not moving
the body sometimes the body also tends
to start to do a little adjustments as
we move and practice yoga all right flex
your foot just begin to lift the heel
slightly and then reach for your big toe
or the outside of your right foot open
the other arm and then allow the knee to
open to the right shoulder so you're
taking it to the side of your
body feeling this nice stretch through
the inner thigh your
hip deep breath
in
exhale remembering that the hips hold so
much emotional heaviness
right the they say the hips are the seed
to your soul so a lot of the times
certain energies through the experiences
we've had if we haven't been able to
release them or process them they tend
to find a spot in our physical body and
just make a home out of it and the hips
tend to be one of those areas so as
we're pro really working on the process
of detoxification today the intention of
Sha
it's really important to recognize that
the hips are that tool to get into those
areas too awaken some of that stagnant
energy and then let it
release good from here extend now hold
the back of your knee and press it up
and let's just hold and feel this nice
stretch through the back of your right
leg
inhale exhale slowly lowering your right
leg and now bring both knees into your
chest extend let's take our happy baby
so both feet are flexed you're opening
the legs grab the outsides of your feet
or the big toes with your piece fingers
maybe add a little bit of movement here
rocking side to side or maybe you just
find
Stillness deep breath in
exhale relax your shoulders relax your
body feel free to close your eyes and
just stay connected to all and
everything that happens
internally great and then from here
let's extend your
knees breing your knees
in and then just start to rock forward
and up forward and back just a little
bit to kind of get some momentum in the
body making the Rocks a little bigger
each time until you're literally rolling
like a ball coming all the way up to our
boat pose or
navasana good last one and then I want
you to come into boat or I'll show you
modification for it so either boat
you're just holding extending your arms
if you not feeling it you can just keep
your feet grounded and reach your arms
forward still engaging through the core
a little bit so really depends on how
intense you want to take it drop your
shoulders away from the ears just hold
starting to activate a little deeper
into that core Center into the solar
plexus a little bit
more inhale exhale cross your ankles
bend your knees and let's transition
over into our hands and
knees good coming into a quick little
cat Cow should feel really nice on your
spine inhale let the belly drop look
up exhale want you to round the spine
same way we did in a seated position now
going a little bit deeper by arching the
back looking up and when you exhale
imagine as if you're pushing the floor
away from you really rounding in that
upper
back inhale
Arch exhale
release good inhale
Arch exhale
release one more inhale
Arch EX exhale
release inhale coming back into neutral
position Naval to spine go ahead and
extend your left leg behind you level
the hips out square the hips pull the
navl into the spine once again
connecting to your core Center and then
if you like go ahead and reach your
opposite arm your right arm forward just
holding this position first this bird
dog here keep pulling and reaching
finding Stillness deep breath
in good and then as you
exhale place your hand down I'd like you
to start to open your left leg out and
then flex and just drop it onto the mat
so you're just opening a little bit more
into the hip once again from here same
arm left arm is going to reach up to the
sky and then as you exhale you're going
to thread it through but don't come all
the way down just almost like you're
just trying to touch the other side of
the mat so it's hovered above the floor
inhale reach
up exhale
open inhale reach
up
exhale work with arui breath inhale
reach up now exhale this time I want you
to drop your shoulder down all the way
onto the mat you can either extend your
right arm forward and hold keep the
elbow bent or I'll show you one more
modification a little bit more ADV adved
for those of you guys that are looking
for that and that is to reach your right
arm up and then bend the elbow and see
if you can actually reach for that inner
thigh on your left side so bit more of a
bind here again you don't have to go
there you can just keep the arm in front
really depends how your body responds
but I do want you to notice the
sensation through the outside of your
left shoulder so what I find personally
sometimes to go deeper into that area to
actually Square the shoulders and reach
your right arm forward you're going to
feel a little bit more
intensity so there's a a couple
different places that we're working with
here you can either reach forward to
adjust a deeper sensation in your arms
or work a little more with that binded
twist it's really your
call wherever you are close your eyes
for a
moment just focus on the breath focus on
the UI
exhalation focus on all of the the
things that you are
ready to leave behind and not take with
you in
2025 be qualities it could be
habits could be
different rituals that you used to
negative rituals would have maybe ritual
is the wrong word for it but negative um
activities whatever it is small or
big just make that conscious awareness
of what you are already committed to
leaving
behind and breathe a little deeper into
it all right now to release just come
back to
neutral come over to Center and now take
both of your arms forward you can Flex
the back foot to make it a little easier
and just push back for a moment so
feeling a deeper stretch through through
the inner
thigh and then begin to crawl your
fingers forward and opening into a puppy
pose
variation so opening a little more in
the shoulders if this is too difficult
with the arm uh excuse me the leg out
then you can bring both knees down and
just take a regular puppy okay I just
like this little extra
fancy fancy modification just to get a
little deeper into the hip
good from here come back up bring your
hands back
over bring your knees together inhale
Arch the back exhale round the spine
just another set of your CAD cows inhale
Arch exhale
round inhale
Arch exhale
round one more
time
exhale inhale neutral extending your
right leg Square the hips pull your navl
into the spine finding that Center
connection and then reaching the
opposite arm all we're doing is just
holding we're finding balance trying to
make sure you're not doing that little
teeter totter action so engage find
Stillness
hold awaken the muscle
great then from here left hand comes
down open and reach reach reach reach
reach that right leg and then dropping
the foot down left hand stays grounded
just reach your right arm up to the sky
or the same arm as the leg and then
reach and thread it through for one so
follow the breath reach exhale
two reach reach and
three
reach and
four good one more reach
inhale and exhale take that arm through
dropping your shoulder and this is again
where you're going to play and take it
to what feels right for your body so
maybe you're going to just hang out here
maybe you're going to reach your arm
forward feel this nice stretch or you
can rest take your left arm up and then
bring it behind behind your back and
just feel this nice stretch through the
hips through the shoulders and so many
different
areas in these moments of Stillness here
in these ASAS I encourage you to close
your
eyes because it just allows you to kind
of shut the world out for a moment and
come in and notice everything that's
happening externally and internally so
externally meaning within your body
physically and then internally
what is happening in your mind and your
heart where does your mind go what are
what pulls it because it happens to all
of
us we are always being pulled by
thoughts memories
emotions so just inquire where what is
it that keeps pulling me is it good is
it bad meaning is it negative or
positive to your life
and if it's not bringing positivity to
your life can you exhale it out can you
consciously see what that is that
negative pull and can you exhale it and
almost like you're releasing it into the
stream of a
river just let it
go let's release the arm bring it
forward good and then opening here deep
breath in flex your back foot and just
take a little shift back with your hips
you get a little deeper into the inner
thigh
first take a
breath and then as you
exhale walk and crawl your fingers
forward so now you want to where you
want to go is bring your hips right
above your knee that's the alignment and
then you want to allow your heart center
to drop
so so you can start to really feel this
through the upper back you can relax the
back toes if that feels
better deep breath
in
exhale and then slowly come back up
awesome my friends come back over with
both knees and hands on the mat and then
from here go ahead and tuck your back
toes deep breath in on your exhale I
want you to shift your weight back kind
of like you're doing a downward dog but
we're going to keep the knees actually
bent for now so quite bent so almost
like you're
hovered now from here you're just going
to transition and bring yourself back
into all four so dropping the knees or
if you want a little more intensity
hovering the knees above the mat like a
bare pose or bare stance and then push
back so we're just going to do this a
few times I'm going to hover mine but
you're more than welcome to drop them if
you need to and then push back so bring
it forward so starting to aaken a little
more in the shoulders as well which is
going to prepare our body for different
chaturangas and plank positions take it
back good bring It Forward
and back one more
time exhale back and then from here
starting to extend one leg at a time and
walking out our downward-facing
dog good adding as much movement as you
like

dog holding your downward facing dog I'd
like you now to just take your right
hand and reach for the outside of your
left knee or if you can start to move

eventually what you want to do is grab
your ankle but I understand for some of
you that not may not be possible today
and that's to toally fine grab your calf
muscle or the back of your knee wherever

slightly twist and open and look through

the front of your mat inhale let's come
up to our tips of our fingertips or
slide your hands up your shins but
lengthen through the back exhale we're
going to release into that forward
fold just take a moment here breathe
bend your knees and start to roll up for
three for
two one coming up to sasti here finding
that grounding through the feet just
open up through the shoulders really
feel the Earth underneath you allowing
this sensation the gripping of your toes
on the mat to ground
you if your mind is feeling like it's
going to 100 places right now normal
don't worry about it but use the
sensation of this grounding onto the mat
to kind of ground your mind at the same
time just pull it back control it bring
it into this present
moment this is where you are and this is
the only place you need to be right
now on your next breath inhale let's
reach both arms up to the sky opening

dog then exhale push back now downward
facing dog
good beautiful now inhale from here
reach your right leg up to the sky I
want you to keep your hips Square so
don't open and think about height but
think about alignment and square of the
hips so you're going to feel this a
little deeper in the calves and the
hamstrings then bend your right knee
pull the knee into the chest pull pull
pull just hold three two maybe come up
to the tippy toes one and then step your
right foot between your two
hands good hold it
here finding this Crescent lunge bend
your left knee and reach up into low
lunge with the arms
up good inhale open a little deeper and
then place your hands over to anelim
mudra in your heart center drop the
shoulders away from the ears and then
begin to twist towards your right twist
and look over your shoulder and then
taking your left elbow to your right
knee coming a little
deeper good hold it here your back knee
is is grounded on the
mat now see if you can bring all of your
weight into that right foot inhale and
then exhale begin to lift your back knee
off the mat and then drop it down so
we're just doing a little tap first and
drop it
down lift and down
lift and down let's hold here for three
breaths if you like go ahead and come up
into a full Twisted Crescent lunge or
stay down with your knee on the mat
whatever feels
good good and then bring that knee down
if it's not already there release the
toes untwist the body reach the arms up
push the hips a little further forward
without sacrificing the alignment of
course of your front knee over your toes
so make sure the knee is on top of your
ankle deep breath in and then as you
exhale take the arms to the left side of
your mat and I want you to heel toe your
foot to the right side so coming into a
lizard like
position and just allow the knee to open
slightly breathing here
inhale and when you're ready to Exhale
you're going to push away flex your foot
and extend so kind of like a half split
position but we're slightly adjusted in
the body so our arms are reaching to the
left foot's more on the
right good hold it
here inhale come back to
Center and then as you exhale what
you're going to do is actually take your
hands to the other side heel toe your
foot to the middle of your mat and then
begin to extend one more time but this
time now walk your hands to the opposite
side so a little more of a Twist
stretch keeping that front foot flexed
so you're getting a little deeper into
the
hamstring great job then come back to
center now inhale look up exhale Bend
and release half split let's work with
the breath inhale look up
exhale inhale look
up
exhale hold for a breath
in exhale just notice the sensations in
the hamstring here in the
hips and then slowly transitioning
forward back into our low lunge Arms
Reach back up to the sky drop the
shoulders away from the ears can you
tuck your back toes behind you and lift
your back knee now transitioning into
Crescent lunge hold and hover hold and
open breathe for
three
2 one shift your weight over to your
front foot and lift your left leg good
again not about the height but more
about the alignment inhale exhale bend
the back knee and bring it behind your
right knee work with the breath inhale
inale
extend exhale Bend behind inhale reach
and push exhale Bend last one
inhale now exhale you're going to bend
all the way until you drop that left
shin to the mat and you come down into a
seated position coming right into a
Twist reach and hug your right knee into
your body reaching your right hand
behind and now watch how see my hip was
up now you want to square everything out
and drop both sip bones into a seated
spinal twist if you want to go deeper
take your elbow across and reach and
look over your right shoulder closing
your eyes and
breathing so the beautiful thing about
twists and detoxification and
purification of the body is that when
we're twisting we're constricting so
many different organs within
us and through this constriction then
when we untwist we force fresh new blood
flow to come right into our digestive
system so this is where it allows our
body and it aids our body to kind of let
all of that old toxins anything that is
still there to be cleansed and released
out of our system so this is why it's
important to just find that breath in
your
twist exhale then we
untwist come back to Center
hands onto the mat shift your weight up
so you're going to lift up take your
time if you need to and then extend and
reach your left leg back behind
you good now bend your supported knee
and see if you can lift up so find that
balance hands at your heart
center good bring your knee up and let's
take it into a nice tree either take it
to the inner thigh or inner calf muscle
so if you're taking to the inner thigh
you can use your hand for a little
assistance good and just find your
balance now important to again pull navl
to spine hold it
here tuck that tailbone
under coming back to Center bring your
left knee up to your belly button step
it back Midway onto your mat inhale
reach up
lengthen good exhale take the arms
behind your back grab your opposite
elbows and begin to lead with your chest
with your heart come about halfway and
then come all the way down to Pyramid
releasing your forehead over to your
knee if you wish of course place your
hands onto the
mat for a little more support or if
you're using blocks for your practice
today blocks are always helpful because
you can place two hands onto blocks now
I want you to think about um pulling
your right hip back and pushing the left
to forward so that little bit of
alignment squaring off of the hips and
then with each exhalation you're
allowing your body to come forward over
top of your right
leg
good stay here or I I welcome you to try
one more Twist by placing your left hand
to the outside of your right foot or
onto your block if you have one and then
you can take your right hand place it
behind your back and start to look up
less so or one more version up in level
is to reach your arm
up taking a rever reverse triangle
here deep breath
in exhale
out
beautiful and release come back to
Center slightly start to bend the front
knee as you bring your arms up and step
forward to the front of your mat back
into that sasti opening through the body
inhale
exhale inhale reach your arms up open up
through the chest maybe go a little
deeper exhale forward fold all the way
down inhale halfway or slide your hands
up if that's better exhale bend your
knees step back into high plank position
sh chataranga or knce chest Chin
upward-facing
dog and exhale push back downward facing
dog great on your next breath we're
going to reach your left leg up so same
thing my friends less of a
open stacked hip position and more about
Square the hips and just
lift from the glutes so the height is
going to be much less than what you
would get with a single-legged
dog but what we're trying to go for is a
little deeper sensation through the back
of your
legs good from here Point your toes bend
your knee maybe come up to your tippy
toes of your right foot and just bring
this left knee to your chest hold for
breath
in exhale step your left foot to the
front of your
mat opening here for a moment hold
good and then drop
your left knee down let's open into low
lunge for a
moment good deep breath
in exhale hands together
sasti twist start to look over towards
your left side you can either stay here
or place your elbow to your left knee I
like to do that because it actually
gives me that opportunity to push a
little bit more into my front knee which
forces me to have a deeper twist
sensation so really your call so you can
either do that and if you do that
lifting the back elbow up to the sky
will assist or just stay in that
twist a deep breath
in now stay exactly where you are tuck
your back toes behind you and just lift
the back knee for one
and lower
down for
two lower
down for
three good last one hold it
here maybe look
up find your breath I want to say close
your eyes but it might be a little
challenging with the balance but try it
it's always fun to close your eyes and
see how that changes your equilibrium
here good and then come down drop your
knee untwist the body reach your arms up
and then take your arms towards the
right side of your mat just heel toe
your foot over to the left for a moment
I like to drop the hips first just to
really open up through the hip flexors
you should feel really nice on your hips
and then from here we're going to push
back flex your foot so like a variation
of our half split just a little bit
different because we can reach towards
the right keep your left leg slightly to
the
left deep breath
in
exhale come back to
center now bring your body forward just
heel toe your foot so it's along the
center of your mat and then bring your
arms to the left side begin to walk
extend your leg and then walk over to
the other
side so just just a nice little reach
over to the opposite
direction deep breath
in exhale
out back to
Center Bend your front knee come back
over into low lunge reach both arms up
to the sky open up up through that Heart
Center
inhale exhale tuck your back toes and
see if you can lift up hold our Crescent
lunge really finding that power that
strength in our lower body see how low
you can come down with your hips of
course without sacrificing the alignment
hips are
square reach up
inhale exhale now dive your arms forward
shift all of your weight to that left
foot hold for a moment lifting your
right leg inhale then as you exhale Bend
both knees and place the right knee
behind your left inhale
extend exhale bring it back inhale
extend
exhale one
more exhale let start to bend all the
way down come into Seated on your mat
grounding your bones
inhale and then exhale either just give
a big hug of your left knee take your
left arm behind you or deepening The
Twist take that elbow cross push and
twist once again I remind you alignment
right this is very normal to kind of
feel like we're hunched over twisting
imagine I put a string to the crown of
your head and I start to pull that
string like a puppet and you start to
pull up pull up pull up pull up so
you're lengthening through the spine and
then you add that Twist of the neck
first you want to elongate the
spine good
constricting all of our digestive organs
there The
Twist good come back to Center untwist
the body welcome that fresh blood flow
come forward extend push back push back
push back with that
knee your leg is extended behind you
deep breath in exhale slight Bend of the
left knee and come on up gentle with
control it's okay if you fall out bring
your right knee up flex your foot and
then take your foot to the inside of
your left inner thigh or calf coming
into our tree hands in sasti finding
your balance connecting rooting through
your
foot finding that Focus that grounding
I want you to connect with this this
feeling this feeling of complete
presence and ask yourself can you carry
that through the rest of your
practice and then can you carry it
forward through the rest of your day can
you stay present and aware today of
everything everything that happens
internally
externally can you just be
aware coming back to Center bring your
knee back back up and then step towards
the middle of your mat inhale open and
extend and then exhale start to guide
yourself forward with the heart maybe
take the arms behind your back grab the
opposite elbows start to release into
your pyramid you can also release the
hands onto the
mat Square the hips out and allow your
chest to relax over top of that leg

serve you be released into the
river see it being carried by the stream
of the water away from you out of your
body your mind your Consciousness your
energetic field Just Let It
Go lift your heels off the mat bend your
knees I'd like you to jump forward and
hop and land in our yoga squat massana
so to do that you're going to land both
feet to the outsides of your hands and
then come right down with your hips if
you have a block place a block under you
if that's a little easier otherwise just
stay here and I'd like you to press your
hands against one
another and use your elbows to push the
knees
away bringing that tailbone
down opening the
hips a beautiful ASA that does help a
lot in the process of
digestion deep breath in
good
exhale place your hands down lift your

slightly so they're parallel see if you

our backs let's just place the soles of
our feet together opening into a nice
butterfly pose holding your ankles or
your toes whatever is good for you
inhale
open and then as you exhale just allow
your body to
release really feeling this sensation in
your hips once once more I even like
sometimes to go slightly to each side so
I'll go left and right as I find for me
personally it gets a little deeper into
the lower back area especially if you
hold
tightness a deep breath
in exhale
awesome slowly come on
up bring your knees together and let's
make it all the way down gently come all
the way onto your
back pulling your knees into the chest
let's close our eyes and just relaxing
the body massaging your lower back by
gently moving side to side or maybe even
in a circular motion with your knees
just stimulating your parasympathetic
nervous system here to
relax and then from here let's take
one more twist place your uh hands over
your left knee extend your right leg
just like we did earlier but this time
we're going to take a full deep Twist by
taking your right hand and leading and
guiding the left knee across your body
and then taking your left arm over and
just look over your shoulder and notice
everything that happens through your
back through your glutes through your
shoulders try to keep them on as close
to the mat as
possible deep breath
in and
[Music]
exhale connecting to Our intention
again
welcoming the idea of sh
shti purifying the
body through the power of our breath
through the power of our
movement come back to
Center let's switch to the other side
extend your knee other knee comes in
take a breath in on your exhalation push
the other knee
across extend your arm
never mind you it's normal to get a
little crack in the spine here actually
should feel quite nice if that happens
just readjusting your own
body just breathe close your eyes go
inward this is a moment for you
too to bring that experience into your
heart into your soul
into your inner world
beautiful and slowly from here come back
over to
neutral bring both knees into your chest
maybe curl up a little bit and just take
one breath
in then exhale we're just going to open
and release
into our
shavasana relaxing your legs your arms
opening the palms of your hands open the
shoulders and let's close off this
practice with a couple of deep
breaths staying with that uay
breath with that exhalation
that peaceful ocean sound in the back of
your throat allow your body to relax
allow your body to be
heavy relax your
face allow your jaw to be
relaxed your shoulders to be
relaxed and just move that sensation of
peace and relaxation all the way down
your
body with each breath allowing yourself
to feel
heavier
heavier and heavier on your mat
with this space that we've created today
in our
hearts I Want You to Breathe In all the
most beautiful
energy you can visualize this energy in
a form of light
white or golden
colored coming into your body with each
inhale and then this beautiful golden
light moving through every cell of your
body taking away all that no longer
serves
you anything toxic
negative clearing it away
making you
healthy
vibrant

happy seeing this Golden Light bringing
joy into your body
allowing this Golden
Light to bring in peace into your body
now I welcome you to stay in this shabas
for as long as you need to today please
don't feel like you have to come out
just because the class will be
closing so if you need to just stay in
this state stay in this connection for
as long as you
need however if you are choosing
to close off with me then go ahead and
just wiggle your fingers and
toes add a little bit of movement energy
back into your
body open your eyes maybe and then just
move your
feet bring your knees into your chest
slowly and
gently and then roll over to one side
just coming into your fetal position for
a
moment and then bringing yourself up to
your seated position on your
mat just finding that grounding once

just stay connected internally
just place your hands at your heart
center and your anul mudra one last
time taking a deep breath
in and as you exhale gently bowing down

[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
hello my friends Welcome to our full
body energizing gentle flow so today's
practice is going to be all about waking
up our body and getting the energy
lifted from the inside out we're going
to be moving through some different ASAS
to work a little bit more on the
flexibility opening of your heart and
just leaving you feeling amazing at at
the end of this practice now for this
class today we won't need any particular
props but I always recommend having
anything that you like for yourself so
meaning if You' like to use some blocks
for a little bit more assistance please
go ahead and have those ready or
sometimes a bolster I'll have a pillow
ready just for a couple of postures for
myself so again it's a personal decision
so grab whatever you need and let's
begin
[Music]
all right friends so we're going to
begin today in a seated position feet
crossed in front of
you we're just going to start by first
coming into the body right A lot of the
times things are just happening
externally we're kind of reacting to
everything that's happening outside of
us so right now this is an opportunity
to just come into a still seated
position close your
eyes and together let's take a deep
breath in through both
nostrils just welcoming that
expansion of your belly of your ribs of
your heart
then exhale letting it
go good and again deep breath
[Music]
in and exhale just welcoming yourself
into this present moment setting an
intention for our practice to stay in
the present moment as much as
possible meaning that as soon as your
mind starts to wander off into many
directions which most likely will happen
and it's normal come back to the breath
and allow the breath to Anchor you back
into your body let's take another deep
breath
in this time I'd like you to reach both
of your arms up to the sky and just feel
this nice Awakening stretch so you're
reaching up lengthening as much as
possible then on your exhale we're going
to do a side body stretch by just
releasing one hand down the other arm
reaches to the front or back of your
matat and close your eyes if you like to
continue to stay in that inward
awareness otherwise keep your eyes
open again I'm going to give you guys
today lots of different options to
personalize your
practice so always taking the
modification that you
need or taking the more advanced version
if you need that as well everybody here
is in their own path so it's all about
just listening to your body and
adjusting the practice to fit you
today let's take another deep breath
in and exhale come back to center now as
you come to the other side the hand that
was on the mat is going to reach for the
opposite knee the other hand comes
behind and just take a gentle twist
looking over your
shoulder now you can twist as much as
you need to here here now I myself am
about 4 months pregnant right now so I
won't be going into any deep twists but
I'm going to be guiding you into them
but I want you to take yourself to the
depth that you need okay come back to
Center let's take it to the other side
so same thing we reach up we lengthen
through the
body and then we exhale take it to the

position ground the back heel onto the
mat and you're going to cartwheel the
arms so right arm left left arm and
coming into our Warrior 2 all right so
before you go right deep into it let's
just adjust our alignment so tuck that
tailbone under as you bend the front
knee check that you can still see your
big toe arms out to the side and then
you can go as deep as you are
comfortable
inhale
exhale go a little
deeper inhale again
[Music]

arm front meaning your back arm comes
behind your back reaches to the front
knee as the other arm reaches to the
back of your mat going a little bit
deeper into this Peaceful Warrior
inhale exhale come forward extending the
front knee inhale
again exhale reach forward and then
release into a triangle
trosa now you can place the fingertips
onto the mat or if you have blocks you
like to use here that's great or you can

bit more challenging for the balance but
it's up to you so just try it out look
up to the sky look towards those right
fingertips breathe into the side body
here
inhale
exhale let it
go inhale again
[Music]
exhale come on up reaching both arms up
to the sky flex your left foot begin to
bend the back knee and come into our
skandasana so a couple different
variations here you can just hold and
hover your hips slightly off the mat a
little bit more challenging sometimes
easier you can come down a little bit
further back and actually rest your leg
on the mat and kind of keep your hands
on the floor a little different
sensation a little different aen I would
even say but again this is just about
finding what feels right on your body
today okay so wherever you are hold it

heart deep breath

weight back so you're right on that

space here to be seated on both of your
sip bones inhale reach both arms up then

deeper with the
[Music]
breath inhale
again exhale slowly come up and from
here we're going to start to walk back
with our hands as far as you're
comfortable now if you have that pillow
or whatever you're using like a bolster
this is perfect to actually place behind
you at this time and you can lean back
on it if you don't have it that's
totally fine as well because the other
option is to come down onto our
elbows so single-legged Hero's pose
we're here the next version much deeper
is to actually come down with your
entire back on the mat and then Place
both arms over your head like so all
right so if you like to go that far go
ahead otherwise you can choose one of
the other
variations let's just hold

squaring off the hips of course if you

good if you need
it deep breath

we are live streaming it to you right
here from this studio so if you haven't
had the opportunity yet to join feel
free to click the link in the
description and you can find out all the
information about how to join otherwise
I'm so excited to welcome you all of you
guys YouTube and our beautiful Community
here on Boh beautiful official to this
very deep releasing 90minut Yin Yoga
practice so in our daily dose we like to
have a some sort of theme or initiative
or an intention that we set per day and
per practice and so today's intention
isana which is one of the nas which is
part of the eight limbs of yoga with
Pang
and it is a beautiful self-study you
know saana is about self uh it's
studying the scriptures but it's also
studying yourself it is studying your
own experiences and your own Journey
Through the spiritual growth and I think
it's a
perfect perfect perfect way to connect
Yin Yoga because during Yin Yoga we are
going to be going into deep aess where
it gives us the opportunity to just go
within and to study ourselves to study
our emotions to study our body and also
just to learn about how how we're
holding on to energy how we're holding
on to our thoughts and emotions and Etc
so this is a really beautiful internal
practice while at the same time focusing
a lot on the release of muscles and
building flexibility and so much more
now for today's practice I do recommend
using a bolster I have one right here if
you don't have a bolster at home there's
no worries you can always improvise a
good um alternative is just to grab a
big pillow from your bed or even you
know sometimes like couch pillows are
they come pretty thick so if you have
something like that it'll just give you
a little bit more support as we go a
little deeper into some
aess okay uh let us begin
[Music]
[Music]
let's take your prop whatever you're
going to be using your bolster if you
have one perhaps if you don't grab your
pillow and we're going to start in a
nice relaxing opening a here placing the
bolster behind you I have my timer here
by the way so if you see me keep
clicking this here it is my timer
because we're going to be holding each
posture today for 3 minutes so I got to
make sure I keep it right for you all
right bring the soles of your feet
together allow the knees to open and
then place your upper back so maybe
where kind of where for the ladies where
the bra strap area would be that's kind
of the position you want to place your
back so just below the shoulder blades
want to place it on top of your pillow
or bolster and then just open the body
and
relax from here I'd like you to release
the arms and just feeling this opening
sensation through your shoulders your
upper
back this is going to be where we start
today with a nice 3 minute hold while we
start to
bring our awareness
internally inhaling into your
nose then exhaling out
just
welcoming your body welcoming the
day checking in with how you're feeling
in this
moment how are you showing
up how is your body
feeling how was the first week
our first few
days of 2025 is felt for
you can you welcome a
breath of
presence and then
exhale all that feels heavy
today all that is is bringing some
weight on your shoulders today can you
exhale that
[Music]
out can you notice how your hips are
[Music]
feeling can you notice how your
shoulders are feeling
can you welcome a deeper breath and
allow it to guide
you further and further into
relaxation if any discomfort begins to
arise especially in the hips can you
breathe with it first before wanting to
come out or move of course you know if
it's anything and this applies to every
posture today if there's any sharp
electrical pain in your body of course
use that as a cue to come out or reset
yourself but if it's just
discomfort can you sit with
it can you study
it can you try to understand where it is
and what it is and then Breathe It
[Music]
Out stay with your
breath and now from here let's slowly
come out bringing your knees
together reach your arms over your
head and bring your arms down bring your
chin
down and then slowly come come on up
Good Wonderful just sit up tall
inhale exhale we're just going to add a
couple movements today to start off just
to get the body feeling connected so
very gentle seated cat Cow just opening
and exhale
releasing inhale
open exhale
release and then from here you're going
to come up to seated cross your
ankles and just come into a seated
position so you want to start with your
right foot in front now you're going to
take your bolster your pillow whatever
you're using today just bring it to your
right side now I'm just going to Pivot
so I can face you in the front of the
camera but you can sit facing the front
of your mat So Right Foot In Front
pillow along the right I got my timer
here I want you to take an inhale and
just reach both arms up feeling that
lengthening
sensation and then as you exhale you're
going to take your right hand and just
place it on top of the bolster pillow
reaching your left arm and then bend
your elbow place the hand behind your
head and then from here we can do is
actually lift this other hand off the
pillow and almost like you're resting
your your head so literally rest your
head on the other hand now before we
start I just want you to turn and and
open lifting that elbow
up and then extend your arm inhale and
exhale bring it down behind your back as
if you're trying to reach and thread it
through towards the right um thigh the
right hip now very common for us to kind
of let that shoulder drop and if you're
dropping forward you're not going to
feel as much of an intense opening what
I want you to do now is while you rest
your head open that left shoulder like
you're almost trying to look back behind
you open open open open and then see if
you can hold it here looking up towards
the sky again rest your head support
your head with that other hand and close
your eyes so my intention here is to get
you to into that side body into this
glute as well this in the side area here
into the lower back all through the side
right so again it's very important that
you work on the alignment so let's hold
here because as soon as you round
forward you lose the intensity and the B
the benefit of this posture so really
open up open that chest open your
heart
breathe close your eyes
again beautiful pranayama that you can
include into this practice today is uay
breath guys I'm sure have done this
before and i' I've talked about it often
UI breathing is where you inhale through
both
nostrils exhale exhale out of your nose
but almost like you're making that
humming sound in the back of your
throat like literally mimicking the
sound of an ocean
wave this is a beautiful way
to Signal the body to relax it's a very
relaxing calming
breath and I challenge you to work
through that in every ASA we do
today deep breath in
can you go a little deeper if you're
starting to feel the release can you
open that shoulder even further and keep
looking up and again use that other hand
to rest or support even your neck if you
need
to close your
eyes listen to everything that is
happening
internally deep breath in
[Music]
exhale deep breath in
again and new breath exhale
out if holding your neck up high is also
too much you can just rest
here but again just be very very mindful
that that shoulder doesn't fall
down just paying attention to everything
that begins to happen sometimes when we
give our body just a moment to relax at
first you feel nothing and then the body
goes a little deeper and then boom it
just unlocks something in your body and
you start to feel all kinds of
Sensations and I'm not even talking
about physically it also applies to
emotion
mental
release it's normal to begin to remember
certain
situations have your mind wander off
again we don't want to let it go too off
so if you feel like you're somewhere
else and you're leaving this practice
then come back to your breath but it's
also important to just observe observe
where the Mind wants to go observe what
is bothering you maybe what is on your
mind today
can you breathe it out can you come back
to the present moment let's take one
last deep breath in together open up
that
shoulder exhale release so bring the
hand down just
reach and come back up
nice and just take a second pay
attention to the difference between the
two sides then we're going to even it
out so that foot that's closest to your
midline you're going to bring it forward
so now left foot forward right foot
closer to your body take your prop place
it to the other
side and let's go inhale reach
up then exhale first just take a nice
side stretch rest your hand look
up from here bend your elbow and I want
you to really focus on opening lifting
that elbow up and then from here you can
even bring the other elbow forward rest
your head take your arm up bring it
behind and open let's hold here 3
minutes and really opening that shoulder
looking
up now paying attention to the other
side where are you
holding tension today or does it feel
the most
stiff do you feel pain anywhere
[Music]
restriction just
inquire be very mindful that you don't
relax too much that you start to come
forward and don't feel anything so yeah
that right shoulder bring it up and back
like somebody is pulling
you like you're trying to look behind
you look
up but at the same time allow the weight
of your head to be held by that other
hand so you're supporting your
neck if the neck muscles start to get
tired or sore you can of course just
keep your head neutral but still remain
by opening that shoulder out
the beautiful thing about Yin Yoga is
that we work both sides of our body we
try to really focus on that
balance and along with the physical
component of you know releasing both
sides equally there's also an energetic
component that comes with it because we
have masculine and feminine energies
that run through us the
the channels
there's energetic
channels and when these energies begin
to be worked on we begin to inquire and
open
up the body it's it's very normal to
feel different emotions or reactions in
different
sides because our bodies are so
intertwined so the physical stimulation
of an ASA can
stimulate parts of your masculine energy
or parts of your feminine
energy so just inquire and and try to
understand how is this side different
than the
other outside of just the physical
experience how am I feeling this
differently the right side is our
masculine side the sun the sun energy of
our body and then the left is the moon
and the the feminine side and this is
where we can also explore a little bit
of that as well
keep opening that
shoulder and now let's release bring it
back to
Center reach your
arm and come on
upo very nice just roll the shoulders up
and down a few
times maybe take a little cat Cow seated
just to release a little bit of that
tension and then let's bring our knees
together and swing your feet around and
we're going to take your bolster and
just place it to the front of your mat
and come up to all fours
position now from here just a quick heow
once again to get a little deeper into
the spine and to realign the energies
inhale
Arch exhale round and release
inhale
Arch exhale round and
release inhale
Arch exhale
round one more time inhale
Arch exhale round we're going to get a
little bit deeper into the upper body
here for a moment so what I like you to
do is you don't need a bolster for this
but you can take your right arm reach it
up and then as you exhale you're going
to thread it through you're going to
thread all the way until the right
shoulder comes down on the mat now I'm
going to show you a couple variations
variation one is just to stay here maybe
reach your left arm forward variation
two would be a little easier on the
knees if you do feel this a little bit
on the knees is to actually sit back to
your heels like a child's pose and then
just release
forward now wherever you are I want you
to think about this left shoulder and
bring it down as close as you can so the
more you think about squaring off the
shoulders the deeper you're going to
feel a release through the arm so let's
come into our position take a deep
breath in
together and exhale here holding
this closing your eyes so again you can
try both and then see what feels better
and then stay in your preferred
variation we really focusing on the
release along the outer
shoulder continuing to drop that
left shoulder
down stay with your
breath inhale and
exhale
inhale and exhale
[Music]
coming back to that awareness of the
energetic
body the masculine the feminine energies
that run through
you there
are the nadis the channels of
energies which intertwine in the center
which is known as your child
chakra but these energies are moving and
all constantly flowing through
you pingala energy which is the
masculine sun energy the right side of
your body and the AA feminine lunar
energy always moving through
[Music]
you but depending on the circumstance of
your life or whatever's happening or
your
reactions one can be dominant over the
other the goal of yoga and our practice
is to balance the energy is to balance
the Sun and the Moon
energy creating that Harmony
within stay
here breathe in this peace into the
body noticing everything that's
happening through the upper body at this
time your
shoulders go ahead breathe and stay here
we got 30 more seconds to go
[Music]
inhaling through your
nose and exhaling
out listening to that
breath
beautiful now to come out slowly bring
your gaze forward and just start to come
out and release the hand maybe do it a
little
Shake bring your hand back down all
Force position just do a little wobble
side to side to reconnect with that
energy again and let's balance it out
we're going to go to the other side so
left arm reaches up exhale bring your
left arm
through drop your left shoulder down and
now very very mindful of the alignment
so think about that right shoulder
coming closer to the mat reach your
right arm forward and we're going to
reset our timer here and let's hold
breathe in
exhale
out and I want you to take the
opportunity to explore your body a
little bit so don't just come into the
pose and hold I want you to feel the
different angles of it so sometimes
because our bodies are so different some
of you might feel a deeper release if
you just slightly bring your hips back
just a little bit if you're on your
knees others might feel a deeper release
if you walk your fingers forward and
slightly bring your body forward not to
the extreme that you take a different
ASA but just that little slight
adjustment it's going to hit different
parts in your body and it's going to
trigger that release depending on where
the tension lies for you so I encourage
you to explore a little
bit and each ASA that you take move a
little bit forward and back side to side
and find that spot for you and then once
you found that tension where that
restriction is the the most then you
breathe into
it you use that
exhale to initiate a sense of relaxation
in the
ASA to allow the body to let
go to bring oxygen into the
muscles bring more oxygen into the heart
into the blood
to give your body the permission to
release lactic acid and all kinds of
toxins that perhaps have been built up
and stored in your
muscles creating that space for your
body to release
physically and mentally and
emotionally paying attention to your
breath in each
ASA is your breath breath
different how is it different from the
other
side are you breathing more steadily or
more rapidly in these different
ASAS it'll all tell you it's so
fascinating to explore our bodies in
this way and how we react to all of
these
positions deep breath in
exhale
out okay from
here come back
up and slowly take your time bring
yourself over to your hands and
knees maybe take a Little Rock side to
side all right and now let's go a little
bit deeper into the again we're staying
with the upper body into the triceps so
go ahead and bring your prop so your
bolster or your pillow whatever you're
using come a little bit closer we're
going to take a puppy pose but I'd like
you to place your elbows on top of your
bolster or pillow connect the palms of
your hands together and then from here
you're staying with your hips above your
knees you're going to start to allow the
Heart Center to drop
down taking it as far as you're
comfortable and then maybe even resting
your forehead on the pillow or the
bolster or just letting it kind of hang
out here and then begin to bring your
thumbs closer towards your neck towards
the back of your head so this release
not only opens the
shoulders the upper back back but it
also starts to get deeper into the
tricep
region which should feel really nice
especially if you've been doing lots of
chaturangas so breathe here let's hold
here for 3
minutes closing your
eyes inhale
exhale follow that UI breath
exhale taking this opportunity
to study study
yourself study your
breath study the sensations in your body
how can you welcome more relaxation into
this
ASA what can you do to let go a little
bit
[Music]
more noticing how your body
let's
go it starts to relax little bit by
little
bit so work with that as
well breathe into that
[Music]
listen to that breath that ocean sound
that you're
making can you open a little deeper
[Music]
[Music]
as we approach the finish line of the
ASA hold it's very normal to get feel
antsy it's getting intense you want to
get
out but I encourage you to when you feel
this to breathe a little deeper to stay
a little longer can you face that
sensation head on and not give into it
yet can you hold and push through a
little bit
more give your body that deeper release
that it
needs and from here let's release the
hands the
arms and come on out well done my
friends just come up to Center maybe sit
up on into your
heels just roll the shoulders back a
little bit maybe roll it side to
side just just give yourself a little
mini
release good all right and then from
here let's just slide the hands back up
you can move your prop a little bit out
of the way so it's not in your way and
you have lots of space ground the hands
of your T fingers onto the mat squeeze
and really grip the mat push the palms
of your hands into the mat so you
activate in the shoulders tuck your toes
under and then from here let's just lift
the body lift the hips and start to walk
out your downward facing
dog good stretch out your calf muscles
your hamstrings give a little bit of
movement into your
hips again movement is not something we
we do in Yin Yoga it's all about
Stillness but just for the time being I
want you to give your body a little
release before we go back into more
Stillness and more
holds Good deep breath
in exhale let's just hold your downward
facing dog for a moment your shoulders
should feel quite open and loose now
which is great now we're going to go a
little more into the low
body allow the heels to release to the
mat with each breath maybe keep your
knees bent if you are struggling with
that
back
inhale
exhale inhale
again
exhale good from here you're going to
take your right knee now and bring the
right knee towards your right thumb now
like a pigeon pose but we're going to do
it slightly different today you're
actually going to let your your hips
drop all the way to the right and then
look at your legs and create a 45° Bend
in both legs Flex both feet take your
prop and from here you're going to start
to Pivot with that left hip so we want
to square off our shoulders as much as
possible this is a slight modified
version of a pigeon but it's accessible
should be accessible for for everybody
so push the hip a little bit more and
then you're going to start to walk your
hands forward until your elbows can come
onto your bolster now from here before
we start the timer I want you to just
explore the body a little bit noticing
where is the tension the most here
adjust your body maybe you need to kind
of walk your foot the foot that's in
front a little bit forward the more you
bring it parallel to the front of your
mat it could feel a lot
deeper so play with it and then when you
found a good spot for yourself take a
deep breath in and then exhale we're
going to come down now you have a couple
variations you can stay on your elbows
if the intensity is enough as it is here
or you can go a little deeper and
actually rest your body over top of your
pillow or bolster if this is still not
enough for you you can release the
bolster and come all the way down to the
floor okay so take it to your own level
I'm going to get the timer going and and
breathe and just relax smile close your
eyes let's explore what starts to happen
in our lower
body especially in the right glute in
your right inner thigh in your hamstring
[Music]
even breathe
in breathe
out notice if you start to feel any sort
of pulsation happening in your
glute a lot of the times the muscle when
it is so tight and restricted it kind of
almost Shivers a little bit it it
Quivers and then and then it'll let go
at least I found that for my body and so
if that's happening what's important is
for you to deepen the breath is to not
just come out but okay the resistance is
there the tension is there can I hold it
and can I breathe more oxygen into that
region of my body to give it that much
more of a deeper
release and then we begin to take that
inquiry
further and start to pay attention what
begins to happen on the emotional
level is there any emotions that you
feel begin to become
triggered can you sit with that
emotion not surpr press
it every motion is welcome here this is
your practice this isn't the time to
hold it together as we would say this is
a time to
release this is your time to go Inward
and in your own safe
space let go of
everything that is still weighing you
[Music]
down letting go of the past
letting go of any anxiety or fear of the
future and just letting yourself sit and
be in this
moment and when those energies
especially negative energies arise as
so can you deepen the breath and welcome
them let them rise let them come
forward and then let them
go if you need to cry if you need to
scream if you need to do whatever you
have feel you have like a feeling to do
then do that don't suppress
it we live in a society where you know
showing emotion can be seen as a sign of
weakness to some people and I don't
agree with
it and at least at this practice I want
all of us to take that idea aside and
realize that being vulnerable and
showing your emotions and allowing them
to enter and be released is one of the
strongest attributes that we can
welcome because it means you're strong
and you can face them you're not afraid
of them and you acknowledge them as just
a part of Being
[Music]
Human all
right take one more deep breath
in and exhale we're going to come
up okay just notice how your body feels
we're going to still work with those
glutes so just push your hips back
you're going to take this back leg now
bring it up bring it around now take the
left heel and just place it on top of
your right knee and then from here begin
to lower into our fire log so this again
is going to look different on all of us
for some of you guys that are a little
more tighter in the hip region you might
be up here and feeling like this is more
than enough for me today this is where
you're going to stay maybe you'll work
with the bolster and just kind of try to
bring that knee down that's your goal
with the as well as bringing the chest
down so as you bring the chest down the
knee will automatically start to be
pushed to the to the floor as well
others might be a little bit more open
and this feels quite comfortable in a
full fire log then you're going to go
deeper so let's all of us together no
matter where we are first welcome a deep
breath in and open through your heart
center through your
chest and then exhale begin to come down
to what feels right for each of us so
some of you guys come down onto your
bolster others might even want to go
deeper and remove the bolster and the
prop and come down with the body as
soon let's hold here for another 3
minutes breathing
deeply now we were focusing on the right
glute this might feel a little bit more
on the left now but still of course
getting both
sides and continuing with that
exploration sitting with those
emotions giving your body and your mind
an opportunity to process
things you know I find so much happens
in our life in our everyday life and
we're so busy that we just move from one
thing to the other without giving
ourselves the proper opportunity to to
process some
things and that's important as
well just trying to
understand how certain circumstances may
have impacted us physically or mentally
emotionally sitting with that not
labeling them this is good or this is
bad but simply just accepting them as is
and trying to hold still in that seat of
a
awareness trying
to accept things as they
are
processing our
experiences that's what it is life is
just moments and moments of experiences
and beautiful and challenging and all in
between but it's
all experiences
and moments that are
fleeing come and go eventually all will
come to an end there'll be new beginning
and it just follows this beautiful
cycle can you stay with that breath and
go a little bit deeper for final 45
seconds here of this
posture can you bring your chin down
closer to your chest to notice if that
makes any difference in the sensation
beautiful let's take one more deep
breath in
together and then exhale come on out
slowly with
control take your body up great job from
here bring your legs
together we do a little
shake and we're going to stick with the
same side still the right side and then
we'll do the whole series on the other
leg so continuing with that right leg I
want you to bring your left knee to your
chest from here I want you to take your
knee and cross it over to single-legged
shoelace now flex your right foot now if
you have a strap nearby sometimes it's
really helpful to take a strap and that
is great if you don't don't worry about
it because there's so many other ways to
work around it I will show you a couple
different variations to get into it let
me just reset the timer so take your
hands first under your bottom knee from
here I want you to lengthen as if
somebody's pulling you from the crown of
your head on your exhalation flex your
front foot and then begin to come down
with your body so getting into that
hamstring string the more you can bring
your forehead to that top knee the
deeper you might feel those sensation
start to come up all the way to your low
back that's very normal because the
muscles are so connected and if you are
experiencing extra tightness there just
accept it and sit with it it will let go
all right so let's get into this
position now for those of you guys that
are a little bit more flexible a little
bit more experien you want a deeper
stretch I'm going to show you something
you can do with the bolster what you can
do is take your bolster actually place
your foot let let me just come sideways
a little bit here um so you place the
foot flat against it then as you start
to lean forward you're holding on to the
bolster and what it will do it will
force your foot to stay flexed which
will allow that deeper sensation through
the calf muscle at times it can actually
feel quite intense but I'm going to give
you that option to
explore as I said again we are all in a
different different place here with our
bod some of us need a little extra depth
others need a little extra space so take
what you need another variation for
those of you guys that need a little
more support is to take the bolster on
top and just rest like so now to me to
be honest I don't feel much of a of a
release so that's not going to be a
version for me but for some of you that
might be where you need to go okay so
take the appro roate
variation let's hold let's breathe let's
explore the
hamstring the lower
back as I mentioned our bodies are so
connected and a lot of the times when
people complain about lower back issues
lower back tension and pain the point
and axis to that release actually comes
from your lower body so targeting the
glutes and the hamstring will actually
release your lower back so something to
keep in mind is that it's not about
stretching your back it's about actually
going a little lower and then releasing
the other muscles which then will help
facilitate the release of low back
stiffness all right my friends close
your eyes just stay
inward noticing where the tension begins
to
dissipate where it holds on and fights
back can you breathe a little deeper
into
it work with your neck a little bit by
bringing your forehead down you'll
notice a deeper
sensation in that back
inhale exhale
[Music]
[Music]
all right my friends let's come on
up bringing yourself up releasing your
foot and just give it a little shake
shake it
out and then you're going to swing both
of your feet over towards the back of
your mat just take your bolster out of
the way step back and let's release into
downward dog and this might feel nice to
just walk it out again I want you to pay
attention to how your sides feel so how
the left feels versus the right it's
very normal to feel one a little more
tighter than the other but don't worry
because we are going to balance all that
out we're going to take it to the other
[Music]
side great let's find your downward dog
take a deep breath
in and then on your exhale we're going
to take your left knee bring it over
towards your left thumb all right from
here un likee we're taking a regular
pigeon pose we're going to shift our
weight and sit on top of your left sip
bone take your left foot Bring It
Forward so it's at about a 45° bend your
right back leg again same thing now
think about just bringing those
shoulders Square so trying to square out
your upper body as much as possible and
then find that bolster
come on down to your elbows I'm going to
start the timer
here to your elbows or go down deeper
into a lying down position with your
heart your chest or remove the prop
completely and come on down to your
elbows or the
mat all right so now let's focus on the
left
side the feminine lunar side of our body
the AA
Nati and when I refer to nadis for those
of you guys that might be a little new
to this so nais are the energetic
channels the pingala is the masculine
Thea is the feminine and they run like
this through our bodies and every time
they intersect it's where we have our uh
connection here of the chakras and
there's an energetic Center Line called
yumna that is where it
intersect and so when you think about it
that
way there's there's so much
fascinating um knowledge to discover
about yourself when you think about the
energetic body and and The Feminine
versus the masculine and how there that
inter relates and correlates with our
life and how we live our
life which energy dominates one part of
our
life just fascinating and this is where
I encourage you to have that more of
that
[Music]
self-discovery self-study the intention
of our of our class
today trying to understand yourself a
little
more find your
breath stay with it don't lose it
[Music]
another interesting thing you can try in
this ASA is push your pinky toe so of
the foot that's in front can you press
your pinky toe down into the mat just
play with it press it down and notice
how it activates a little bit more
through the leg here and it's again
fascinating to see what where the
tension gets discovered through just
that tiny tiny adjustment of pushing
your foot a different way
all right one last deep breath in
here long exhalation
out and slowly come on
up shifting your
weight and then take your back leg swing
it around and let's come into our
log pose so fire log you're going to
take
your heel of your right foot place it on
top of your left knee now from here
we're going to play with it you might
sit here and feel like this is way more
than I need and I'm going to stay here
others you're going to come down use
your block your bolsters whatever you're
using deep breath
in and then exhale let's come on down
here elbows down your forehead can
release if you don't want to use the
bolster and just come down with your
body that's another option it's a little
bit more intense though of
course so remember the the bolster is
there for your help it's to help you go
relax a little deeper in the AAA
because the thing that's really
important about Yun yoga is that when we
get into a posture unlike other
practices and modalities of yoga where
it's about really finding that strength
to hold a crescent lunge or or Warrior 2
or so this is a place where we actually
want to trigger relaxation in the body
so we get into these interesting oenus
and then we want to support our body
with props so that we can actually relax
and then through this relaxation and the
muscles are able to start to let go
we're able to go deeper into the
connective tissues the myofascial
release and all of the good stuff so
it's important that you don't strain
that you're not just sweating and
shaking in these positions use props
give yourself that extra
[Music]
support then when you're comfortable and
you're able to relax this is where you
that also that space is being created
for you to do a little bit of that
internal internal mental
work self- inquiry just studying your
own reaction your own response your own
Sensations within your body
my
friends 45 more seconds to go I want you
to keep breathing
you notice how the side feels compared
to the other the tension is more
intense or less intense
just just be aware pay attention to how
it all feels no judgment or attachment
to it it just accepting it as
is let's take one final deep breath in
together and then as you exhale slowly
begin to release out of this ASA take
your
time bring yourself up to a seated
straight spine position bring your legs
up now extend your left leg and we're
going to take your right knee and cross
it over single-legged shoelace we're
going to play with our props as you
remember from the other side couple
different
versions easiest is to just rest on top
of your bolster as is you are still
creating lots of pressure on your legs
which will force you to have a nice deep
sensation version two remove place your
hand underneath the knee to prevent
hyperextension inhale exhale lower
version three is quite more advanced and
that is to place it in front of your
foot keeping that flexion to its its
maximum holding on to the bolster and
then beginning to release
down all right guys so take whatever VAR
variation you
like and let's go
inward just breathe
in Long exhalation out can you relax
your
body just letting it go
can you play with your head a little bit
here noticing how the more you bring
your chin closer to your chest the more
you lower the forehead down closer to
that knee the deeper the sensation
begins to come up through into the lower
back so play with how that feels maybe
that feels nice for you maybe it's too
much so whatever you need here deep
breath
in exhale for
[Music]
deep breath
in exhale let go a little further
[Music]
[Music]
noticing your
breath paying attention
to the breath itself if it
varies from side to side if it's more
shallow if it's
deeper just noticing
it and through this awareness of the
breath we assist our mind to come back
into the present moment
all right my friends let's slowly come
out take your time you can release your
prop come on up bring your knee up
release it just give it a little Shake
Let It
Go good
right now from
here go ahead and just bring your knees
together scoot forward towards butterfly
pose we're going to bring the hips
closer towards the heels for now let's
just hold on to your toes and do a
little wing flap I call it so just
letting go a little deeper into the
hips
good and then from here take a deep
breath in lengthen through the spine
you can hold on to the ankles if that's
better and then as you exhale we're
going to start to come forward with your
body and I'll show you a couple things
you can do here you can either just rest
um the bolster on top of your feet and
kind of re reach forward as so relax
here you can bring it forward and rest
your elbows like so which will allow
your body to come a little further
deeper to the floor and the other
version is to not use any prop and just
hold on to your
toes and come down all right so let's
hold
here
breathe now feeling the sensation
starting to move from the hamstrings as
they were before into the
hips possibly still in the lower back as
well it's very very normal to feel that
here I want you to close your eyes and I
want you to work with your breath once
again inhaling deeply
exhaling
slowly can you melt your body closer and
closer towards the ground maybe rest
your forehead on the
bolster can you allow your knees to fall
away from you
creating that ocean sound on the back of
your throat as you exhale
[Music]
[Music]
can you welcome all that arises
here you sit with
it befriend it not run away from
it can you express
gratitude to any
Sensations that you might have labeled
negative
can you change and label them with
gratitude Express gratitude
for them showing you your
strength for them showing you your
power helping you find that control it's
because of those
feelings nothing is given to us in our
life without a purpose without a reason
even the most
challenging experiences come with their
deep
lessons and if we can change the way we
look at
things the way we look at the things
that we look at will change meaning that
we will see even negative terrible
experiences as as blessings in
Disguise because they teach us something
about
ourselves or they push us in our life in
a direction that
was difficult but that we're supposed to
go
towards so it's that trust in the
universe and the the greater
Divine that allows us to see everything
that comes to
us as a
blessing whether our ego mind likes to
labor it as good or
bad it's all a blessing
let's slowly come on
up bring your knees
up take your time good maybe just do a
little windshield wipe with the knees
because the hips it's very normal to
feel a lot of soreness and stiffness
here just as we come out of the
asaa
great all right and then from here let's
do one more release of the hamstrings
we're just going to take a seated
forward fold but work with the prop a
little bit so extend your legs rest your
bolster or your pillow on top of your
thighs take a deep breath
in and as you exhale just relax over top
maybe grab your feet or just rest as
so good and just holding
here now for those of you guys that are
super super flexible and this could feel
absolutely like nothing then of course
you can remove the bolster and just
allow yourself to relax over top of your
legs otherwise I encourage you to just
give a little more
support give your body an opportunity to
just relax over top and not have to
strain or pull towards anything and Just
Breathe
Here noticing if you feel any Sensations
through the back of your knees your calf
muscles
inhale and exhale
stay with that oai breath don't lose
it you hear that ocean sound the back of
your
throat try to relax the body along with
it
for
[Music]
inhale and
[Music]
exhale almost there just 30 more
seconds noticing how your body is
responding to this and see if you're
able to feel a little bit of that
release happening if you are can you go
a little deeper
[Music]
[Music]
all right my friends let's slowly come
on
up lift your body up take your prop and
just place it to the side now hands
grounded just shift your weight
forward good just take a moment maybe
Rock side to side a little bit
here and then what I'd like you to do is
come on down onto your
back lay all the way down I'm going to
grab my stuff here so you're going to
lay all the way down and then you are
going to lift your hips like a bridge
position and then slide your bolster or
your pillow whatever you have underneath
your
tailbone and just hold here for a moment
relaxing your body on top and then see
if you can bring both legs up now we're
going we're not going to hold this as a
Yin a 3 minutes but I just want you to
hold it for a couple breaths just feel
this nice
release deep breath
in
exhale and then from here you're going
to bring your right knee into your chest
and because our hips are lifted we're
going to allow that leg to drop all the
way down and start to feel a deeper
opening through the hip flexor and we're
just going to hold this position here 3
minutes now if
you want to bend your knees slightly you
can but the Sensation will decrease so
the more you can extend that bottom leg
the more you can pull your left knee
into the chest the deeper you're going
to start to reach really feel this
beautiful opening through the hip flexor
the soaz muscle and let's just hang out
here close your eyes breathe you don't
have to constantly keep pulling the knee
if that's allowing you to have to strain
yourself but just hold on to it and then
with each exhalation as your body starts
to let go you can play and try to just
gently bring it closer to your
body maybe even rolling out that left
anle if that feels nice just get into
the joints a little
bit breathing
in breathing out
[Music]
maybe do a little rock with that left
knee side to
side trying to explore your own body
here noticing which slight variation of
your leg triggers a deeper opening a de
deeper
stretch and you have to explore that on
your own I can't tell you which dire
direction will work for you because it's
your body right so just listen to it
connect to
it deepen that intuitive connection with
your own body as well just listening to
it letting it guide you to the right
position one more minute here to go deep
breath
in exhale out
[Music]
all right let's take one more deep
breath
in flex your left foot start to extend
your leg up up up up up up up see if you
can just hold the back of your knee
maybe bring the other knee into your
chest to make it a little bit easier or
just hold for a
moment and then drop that left leg
slowly
with control as you pull your right leg
towards your body and let's reset the
time and hold and
breathe
good stay with that
[Music]
breath maybe adding that ankle roll on
the other
side releasing any joints and that ankle
and your feet flexing and pointing your
[Music]
foot finding your
breath maybe taking a gentle Rock side
to side with that right knee once again
just giving yourself that moment of
exploration noticing where is the
tension the most intense for
me and then if you can find and pinpoint
that spot can you hold it and then can
you breathe deeper into it can you
welcome more oxygen into it
[Music]
[Music]
30 more seconds just keep breathing
[Music]
[Music]

you can do
that just take your time that you need
to come back and land inside your own
body once
again now to close off our practice
today I would like us to do one last
quick little pranayama exercise which
will help with everything we've talked
about today in terms of that equilibrium
that balance and Harmony of our energy
and that is called your alternate
nostril breath so I'll quickly just
guide you into the hand mudra of it so
what you're going to do is take your two
piece fingers you're going to place them
on top of your third eye right between
your two eyebrows you're going to take
your ring finger and you're going to
block your left nostril and then your
thumb is going to block the right
nostril okay so that's the hand
positioning here we're going to open the
right nostril and inhale only into the
right while blocking the
left then I'd like you to constrict both
nostrils for a
moment open the left exhale the air out
of the
left good now reverse it inhale into the
[Music]
left BL
walk open the right exhale out of the
right now doing this at your own pace
and your own time two more rounds
[Music]
inhale
block exhale
inhale back into that same nostril that
you exhaled out
of
block
exhale one more round
[Music]
block
[Music]
exhale when you've done your final third
round
just rest your hands on the knees and
breathe
normally
naturally just feeling this connection
this balance within
you feel free to stay here for as long
as you like if you like to move into a
meditation practice you can go ahead and
just stay here and move right into that
it's the perfect time

============================================================

Heat. Heat.
Welcome to the magical land of Iceland.
We are here today with another class of
the exclusive inner warrior yoga series.
This yoga workout today is about
endurance, cultivating the fire within,
and discovering just how strong,
capable, and resilient your body truly
is. Through this practice, we will move
through a powerful and fiery sequence
that blends dynamic yoga flow with the
strengthbuilding movements and stamina
enhancing exercises. It's designed to
challenge you, to take you to your edge,
and then guide you to breathe through
it.
Remember that this practice isn't about
perfection. It's about presence,
perseverance, and pushing through
resistance with grace.
The more you show up, the more powerful
you become.
Once you're ready to begin, grab your
mat and let's get started.
Thank you, my friends, for joining me
here today for this powerful practice.
We're going to get started by first
finding a child's pose along the back of
your mat. Bringing your feet together,
knees together, sit over to your heels,
reach your arms to the front of your
mat. Before we begin, I just want you to
take an opportunity to connect to your
breath. Connect to your body. Connect to
your own energy.
Showing up for yourself on the mat.
Allowing yourself to show up just as you
are.
Welcoming a deep breath.
Allowing this breath to guide you into
presence.
To listen to your body, to take breaks
when needed, and to push yourself
whenever you feel like you can.
So go ahead and welcome another deep
breath in.
And when you're ready, on your next
exhalation, we're slowly going to roll
forward into all fours. Bring your hips
forward. Take one pushup.
Come back into child's pose. Now we're
going to ladder these push-ups. Roll
forward. Back. Now take two push-ups.
One. Staying on your knees. Two. Keeping
your elbows close to you. So we're
working through the triceps. Sit back to
your child's pose. Coming back to
center, taking three push-ups. One,
two,
three, and sit back into child's pose.
And one last time, this time adding in
four push-ups. Go ahead. Four
3
2
one. And then from here, slide forward
and open up into upward-facing dog.
Allowing your shoulders to drop away
from the ears, and then push into the
hands, release the feet, and come into
downward-facing dog. Giving yourself a
moment to just readjust. Feel a nice
stretch through the backs of your legs,
your hamstrings, allowing the heels to
drop down as far as you're comfortable.
On your next exhale, go ahead and come
forward into your high plank position.
Holding here for a moment, really think
of pulling that navl into the spine. And
then from here, we're going to take slow
mountain climbers. So, you're just going
to bring one knee in and then the other.
So, knee to chest. Switch. Alternating
legs. One, two. That's it. One, two.
Take your time. Connect with your
breath. Two. One, two. One, two. You got
it. We're just doing 20. Then we're
going to take a flow after this.
Last three and two. One. Now chaturanga
dandasana. Release the toes. Open into
upward-f facing dog. Exhale.
Downward-facing dog. Open up again. Take
a deep breath in. When you're ready, on
your next exhale, come into three-legged
dog. Right leg reaches all the way up to
the sky.
From here, bend your knee. You're going
to touch your right elbow, touch your
left elbow with the knee, and then
extend back up into three-legged dog 10
times. We go right elbow, left elbow,
extend. Three-legged dog, right elbow,
left elbow, extend.
Come into plank. And just think of that
knee to elbow connection every time.
Bring it back to forward and extend it
back.
Right elbow, left elbow, extend it back.
Right elbow, left elbow, extend. You got
it. Almost there.
Once you finished your final round,
you're going to stay in your plank
position and just work on touching one
elbow at a time without pushing yourself
back to three-legged dog. So, let's do
one more rep.
All right. Now, come forward into your
plank. Touch your right elbow, then your
left elbow, and just switch. Right,
left, right, left. You got it. Right,
left. You're starting to really awaken
the core, the obliques, your lower
abdominals. Keep going. Right, left.
Keep it going. See if you can touch your
elbows. If not, that's okay. Extend back
into three-legged dog. Bring your right
knee into chest. Step forward with your
right foot into high lunge, reaching
both arms up to the sky. Open up through
your chest center. Hold it here.
and then extending the front knee and
taking a squat by bending both knees.
Your back knee hovers above the floor.
Extend and squat for two. Reach. And
three.
And four. You got it. And five.
And six.
And seven.
8. Very nice.
Last one. I want you to hover that back
knee. Hold it here. Cactus your arms. So
bend your elbows and just pulse it. Two.
Little baby pulse. Four. Starting to
really fire up those quadriceps, your
lower body. 8 9 10. Extend your back
knee. Release your arms. Interlace your
fingers behind your back and bring your
chest forward as your arms reach up to
the sky. Nice little shoulder stretch.
Continuing to strengthen your lower
body. And then open the chest back up.
Bend the back knee. Then see if you can
lift your front heel off the mat. So
you're balancing on the ball of your
foot. And then start to pulse one more
time. Three. Maybe a little slower.
Maybe a little bit smaller pulses. See
if you can maintain the heel off the
mat.
Drop the heel. Drop the chest. Arms come
behind you. Inhale.
Hold it here. Exhale. Release the arms.
Reach the heart back up to the sky.
Opening in your high lunge. And then
drop your hands down. Press into the
hands. Extend your front leg all the way
back. You can modify this now by
dropping the knee down if you wish. Or
to make a little more intense, hold in
plank. Tuck your knee in and then kick
the leg back in and back. So now we're
using the core and then stimulating your
glute max here by kicking that straight
leg behind you without sacrificing your
form. So less about arching your lower
back and just about working from the
glute muscle. So the kickback can be
small, doesn't have to be high.
All right. From here, mountain climbers.
You can do the first variation or take a
full mountain climber with a little hop.
Let's go 20 times. Alternating one leg
at a time. Again, slow it down or speed
it up. It's up to you. It's your
practice.
Go. Go. Back into plank. And then take a
flow. Chaturanga. Bring your heart rate
down through this flow. Inhale. Look up.
Exhale. Breathe it out. Downward-facing
dog.
Awesome, my friends. Let's take it to
the other side. When you're ready, just
give yourself another deep breath first.
Exhale out. Go ahead and bring your left
leg up to the sky.
And then bend that top knee. Come into
plank. And bring your knee towards your
left elbow. And then your right elbow.
and then extend back into three-legged
dog. That's right. Left elbow, right
elbow, extending for two.
Left, right, extending for three.
Left, right, extending for four.
Left, right, extending for five.
Left, right, and six.
and seven. You got it.
Beautiful. Two more, my friends.
And then remember the next set of
exercises to stay in your plank and just
work with the knee to elbow. So once
you're ready, go ahead and come back
into plank. And now just touch left
elbow, right elbow, left, right, left,
right. Keep going. Left, right. Really
strengthening through the upper body as
well. Holding your upper body, holding
your weight up. You got it. Left, right,
left, right, left. Extend back into
three-legged dog. Inhale. Exhale. Knee
to your chest and stepping your left
foot to the front of your mat. Finding
your balance in your center. And once
you're ready, reaching both arms up.
Crescent high lunge.
Starting with our lunge squats. So once
you're ready, you're going to extend the
front knee and then you're going to bend
both knees with the back knee hovered
for one and two
and three. You got it. Find your
momentum. Find your control.
The back knee does not touch the mat. It
just comes very close to it. All the
strength is in your lower body.
Beautiful.
One more time. You're going to hover
that back knee off the mat. Bend your
elbows into cactus arms and give me a
pulse. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Extending the
back knee. Opening through your body.
Interlacing the fingers behind your
back. Extend through the heart center.
And then dive your body forward with
your heart. Holding this position with
your arms and knuckles pointed up to the
sky. Opening the heart back up. From
here, bend both knees. So, back knee
bends. And then see if you can lift your
front heel off the mat and add a little
pulse. If this feels too much or too
intense, you can just do another set of
regular pulses with your heel down on
the floor.
Good. Pulse. Pulse. Drop the heel.
Extend the back knee.
Releasing the arms. Now, inhaling,
opening, reaching up. Exhale. Dive your
body down. Ground the hands. Come back
into that plank position. Modify by
dropping the other knee down if you need
to. Knee to chest and then kick it back.
Knee to chest. And nice big kick from
your glute muscle. So I stress it again.
It's not about the actual height of the
kick. It's the muscle that you engage to
do the work. So even if the leg doesn't
go very high, that's okay.
What's most important is that you
activate the glute max here. Bring it in
and back. Now bring that knee in and
take your mountain climbers again. And
you can take it a fast pace or slow it
down. Up to you. Let's go. 2 3 4.
Alternating those legs. Alternating the
knees. Trying to get your knees up high
to your chest.
Keep breathing through this. Stay with
your breath.
Raising that heart rate just slightly.
And then we're going to bring it back
down with our flow.
Keep going.
Awesome.
Back into plank and then take your flow
chaturanga. Release your toes. Let's
open and welcome a deep breath through
upward-f facing dog.
Exhale. Press into the hands. Lift up
and release. Downward-facing dog. Take a
nice big exhale out. Let it go. Inhale.
Wonderful. Now exhale. From here, step
your left foot to the very left edge of
your mat, coming into a lizard-like
lunge.
Then you're going to step back into your
downward dog and take the other leg,
right foot to the very right edge of
your mat.
Step it back. All right, let's keep
alternating. Now, you don't have to do a
full downward dog. You can just come
into plank and then switch. Now, you can
do a full hop here if you wish or
continue with steps. Right foot, left
foot. Maybe speed it up a little bit.
Right foot. So, we're just doing lizard
switches. Some people like to fully hop
through. Again, I leave it up to you.
You can step or hop. Awesome. Just keep
switching. Left leg, step back, right
leg, step to the outside of your hand.
Beautiful. Back to plank. Chaturanga.
Let's open back. Upward-f facing dog.
Bring your breath in.
Exhale. Let it go. Downward-facing dog.
Come back to your breath. Come back to
your body, your intention.
Come back to the present moment. Lift
the heels. Bend your knees. I'd like you
to hop to the front of your mat. Inhale
halfway. Exhale forward fold. Inhale.
Stand up tall and reach both arms up to
the sky. And exhale. Hands to your heart
center.
Connecting to the breath. One more time.
When you're ready, coming into
utkatasana, your chair position, bending
both knees. Your feet, knees stay
together.
Release into forward fold. Inhale
halfway. Exhale, step or hop back into
plank, chaturanga.
Upward-facing dog.
Exhale downwardfacing dog. Lift the
heels. Bend your knees. Hop to the front
of your mat. Halfway lift.
Fold forward. And then bend your knees
and you're going to roll all the way
onto your back like rolling like a ball.
Roll forward. Hands down. Step or jump
back to plank. And take your flow.
Upward-f facing dog. Downward facing
dog. We're going to do this a few more
times. Lift the heels. Bend your knees.
Hop to the front. Halfway lift. Forward
fold. Bend your knees. Come all the way
down. Roll back. Roll forward. Use your
hands for help. Hop or step back.
Chaturanga.
Upward-f facing dog.
Exhale. Downward-facing dog. Moving with
the breath, my friends. Bend your knees.
Hop to the front. Halfway. Forward fold.
Bend your knees. Roll back.
Roll forward.
Step. Hop back to plank. Chaturanga.
Upward- facing dog.
Exhale. Downward-facing dog.
Lift the heels. Bend your knees. Hop to
the front. Halfway lift. Exhale. Fold.
Bend your knees. Roll back like a ball.
Staying on your mat. Now, just roll up
and roll back four times. The goal here
is to not allow the feet to touch the
floor. Roll it back and up. Roll it back
and up. Finding your boat position. And
then placing your hands behind you. Or
to make it more intense, keep your arms
extended. We're going to take boat to
canoe. You extend both legs. Bring it in
for one and two.
And three. You got it. And four. Like I
said, it's much easier if the hands stay
grounded on the mat.
And seven. 8.
Nine. Last one, my friends. 10. Good
job. Roll like a ball again. And then
roll all the way forward. Come back into
your plank position. Chaturanga.
upward-f facing dog. Stretch out your
core. Exhale, releasing into downward
dog. We're going to go a little deeper
into our core. So, stay with me. Drop
down to your elbows. Dolphin planks.
Bring your feet together. From here,
exhale, come into your elbow plank. And
then bring it up to dolphin and dolphin
for two. Plank. And three. Exhale. Bring
it up. Four. You got this, my friends.
Exhale. Five. Bring it down. And up.
Six.
Good. Seven. Working those shoulders,
strengthening your core center.
Plank and dolphin. Plank and dolphin.
We're going to finish this off with hip
dips. Come back into elbow plank. Dip
your right hip. Left hip. Right, left.
20 times. Right, left. Working those
obliques, toning your whole midline,
your whole midsection. And dip. Move
those hips. You can do this. Find your
strength. Find your breath. I know it's
getting tough, but we're almost done.
Holding your elbow plank now. Hold. See
if you can hold it for 30 seconds. Don't
give up. It's in you. That inner warrior
energy is in you. I want you to find it.
We're at the very end of our practice.
Keep holding.
Last 10 seconds. 10 9 You can do this.
Don't give up. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
1 and drop it. Well done, my friends.
Stay on your forearms. Come into sphinx
pose. Stretch out those abdominal
muscles. Well done. Then see if you can
grab those ankles behind you. Pull the
heels in as you drop your forehead. If
it's comfortable for you, see if you can
open up into a bow pose. Really stretch
out the shoulders, your core.
Holding here for a moment. Open up.
Point your toes or keep them flexed.
It's up to you.
And then release. Beautiful, my friends.
Press the hands down onto the mat. Come
up into your knees. And let's just round
the spine. And in our child's pose,
finishing our practice the same way we
started. Breathing in deeply into your
body, into your heart center. This is a
moment where you really bring down that
heart rate, calming the nervous system,
thanking yourself for this beautiful,
intense practice you went through today.
Come on up to seated on your heels. And
when you're ready, let's welcome a final
deep breath, reaching both arms up to
the sky.
And then exhale, bring your hands over
to your heart center.
Let's do that one last time. Inhale. Big
breath. Reach those arms up to the sky.
Bring that energy down to the heart.
Finding a moment of gratitude.
Thanking yourself for your beautiful
practice, for your power, for your
grace, and for your dedication to your
health and to your well-being. From my
heart to yours, thank you so much for
practicing here with me today in
Iceland.
I send you all my love and light and I
look forward to seeing you in our next
class. Thank you. Namaste.Title: Our Biggest Announcement of the Year ➤ Our New Program for Only $1.11 😇
