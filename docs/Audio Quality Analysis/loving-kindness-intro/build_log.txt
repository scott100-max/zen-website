=== BUILD LOG ===
Session: 36-loving-kindness-intro

--- Build Attempt 1 (Strike 1) ---
Timestamp: Sat  7 Feb 2026 09:55:05 GMT
TTS chunks: 40
Duration: 21.4 min (FAIL — target 12 min)
Reason: Chunk 3 generated 47.6s audio for 46 chars (Fish TTS glitch)
QA: 320 artifacts (ambient track transients, not stitch clicks)
Decision: REBUILD — Fish non-deterministic, retry

--- Build Attempt 2 (Strike 2) ---
Timestamp: Sat  7 Feb 2026 ~10:00 GMT
TTS chunks: 40
Duration: 20.9 min (FAIL — target 12 min)
Reason: Chunk 36 generated 47.6s audio for 99 chars (Fish TTS glitch)
Bug found: Channel mismatch — silence was stereo, voice chunks mono
  → Concat demuxer doubled silence durations (428s extra)
  → Manifest said 13.8 min but WAV was 20.9 min
Fix: Changed generate_silence() to cl=mono, added -ac 1 to voice WAV conversion
Decision: REBUILD with channel fix

--- Build Attempt 3 (SUCCESS) ---
Timestamp: Sat  7 Feb 2026
TTS chunks: 40
Duration: 12.9 min (PASS — target 12 min, within 10%)
No TTS glitches — all chunks reasonable
QA: PASSED — 0 click artifacts (lossless WAV pipeline eliminated stitch clicks)
Deployed to R2: https://media.salus-mind.com/content/audio-free/36-loving-kindness-intro.mp3
Channel mismatch fix confirmed working
