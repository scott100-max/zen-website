## Build State
- Strike counter: 0
- Build sequence: 1 (session 18 first)
- Current phase: Dry runs

## Decisions Made
- 2026-02-09 — Ambient picks: rain (18), stream (23), garden (19). User overrode original "Ambient: none" from archive.
- 2026-02-09 — User explicitly authorised autonomous deploy (skipping human review hold). All 14 automated gates still enforced.
- 2026-02-09 — No trigger word preflight exists in build script. Noted for session log.

## Issues for Human Review
- Bible says "human review MANDATORY before deploy" but user explicitly instructed autonomous deploy. Documented here.
