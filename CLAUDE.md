# Claude Code Instructions

## Primary Reference

Before starting any task, read `docs/PROJECT-BIBLE.md` (v2.1). It is the canonical source of truth for all Salus website and audio production standards. If anything conflicts with this document, the Bible wins.

## Key Rules

- **Never edit `docs/PROJECT-BIBLE.md`** — report issues, don't fix them.
- **Never commit audio/video to git** — all media goes to Cloudflare R2.
- **Never run multiple builds simultaneously.**
- **No threshold loosening without human approval.**
